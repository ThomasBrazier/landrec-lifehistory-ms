We identify relict populations that continue to inhabit ancestral habitats, primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. They have mixed with a lineage that has spread to northern latitudes from an unknown glacial refugium and is now found in a much broader spectrum of habitats. Insights into the history of the species and the fine-scale distribution of genetic diversity provide the basis for full exploitation of A.~thaliana natural variation through integration of genomes and epigenomes with molecular and non-molecular phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The aquatic Lemnaceae family, commonly called duckweed, comprises some of the smallest and fastest growing angiosperms known on Earth. Their tiny size, rapid growth by clonal propagation, and facile uptake of labeled compounds from the media were attractive features that made them a well-known model for plant biology from 1950 to 1990. Interest in duckweed has steadily regained momentum over the past decade, driven in part by the growing need to identify alternative plants from traditional agricultural crops that can help tackle urgent societal challenges, such as climate change and rapid population expansion. Propelled by rapid advances in genomic technologies, recent studies with duckweed again highlight the potential of these small plants to enable discoveries in diverse fields from ecology to chronobiology. Building on established community resources, duckweed is reemerging as a platform to study plant processes at the systems level and to translate knowledge gained for field deployment to address some of society's pressing needs. This review details the anatomy, development, physiology, and molecular characteristics of the Lemnaceae to introduce them to the broader plant research community. We highlight recent research enabled by Lemnaceae to demonstrate how these plants can be used for quantitative studies of complex processes and for revealing potentially novel strategies in plant defense and genome maintenance.},

  abstract = {Repair and Recombination                            In most sexually reproducing organisms, the haploid gametes are produced by meiosis, a specialized cell-division during which recombination between the parental chromosomes ensures proper chromosome segregation. Double-strand breaks (DSB) generated in the DNA drive this recombination and are linked to recombination hotspots in the chromatin where histone H3 is methylated on lysine residue 4 (H3K4me) by the Set1C/COMPASS enzyme complex.                                Acquaviva                 et al.                              (p.               215               , published online 15 November) show that the Mer2/Mei4/Rec114 complex of the DSB generating machinery is linked to the Set1C/COMPASS enzyme complex through the Spp1 subunit, which contains a PHD-finger capable of binding to H3K4me. The Spp1 subunit recruits the Mer2 protein to sites where recombination will occur, probably by binding to both the H3K4me-marked chromatin and other factors.                        ,              A protein involved in histone methylation targets the meiotic recombination machinery to chromatin.           ,              During meiosis, combinatorial associations of genetic traits arise from homologous recombination between parental chromosomes. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation marks meiotic recombination hotspots in yeast and mammals, but how this ubiquitous chromatin modification relates to the initiation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on Spo11 remains unknown. Here, we show that the tethering of a PHD-containing protein, Spp1 (a component of the COMPASS complex), to recombinationally cold regions is sufficient to induce DSB formation. Furthermore, we found that Spp1 physically interacts with Mer2, a key protein of the differentiated chromosomal axis required for DSB formation. Thus, by interacting with H3K4me3 and Mer2, Spp1 promotes recruitment of potential meiotic DSB sites to the chromosomal axis, allowing Spo11 cleavage at nearby nucleosome-depleted regions.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite having predominately deleterious fitness effects, transposable elements (TEs) are major constituents of eukaryote genomes in general and of plant genomes in particular. Although the proportion of the genome made up of TEs varies at least four-fold across plants, the relative importance of the evolutionary forces shaping variation in TE abundance and distributions across taxa remains unclear. Under several theoretical models, mating system plays an important role in governing the evolutionary dynamics of TEs. Here, we use the recently sequenced Capsella rubella reference genome and short-read whole genome sequencing of multiple individuals to quantify abundance, genome distributions, and population frequencies of TEs in three recently diverged species of differing mating system, two self-compatible species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) and their self-incompatible outcrossing relative, C. grandiflora. Results: We detect different dynamics of TE evolution in our two self-compatible species; C. rubella shows a small increase in transposon copy number, while C. orientalis shows a substantial decrease relative to C. grandiflora. The direction of this change in copy number is genome wide and consistent across transposon classes. For insertions near genes, however, we detect the highest abundances in C. grandiflora. Finally, we also find differences in the population frequency distributions across the three species. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that the evolution of selfing may have different effects on TE evolution on a short and on a long timescale. Moreover, cross-species comparisons of transposon abundance are sensitive to reference genome bias, and efforts to control for this bias are key when making comparisons across species.},

  abstract = {Multiparental populations are of considerable interest in high-density genetic mapping due to their increased levels of polymorphism and recombination relative to biparental populations. However, errors in map construction can have significant impact on QTL discovery in later stages of analysis, and few methods have been developed to quantify the uncertainty attached to the reported order of markers or intermarker distances. Current methods are computationally intensive or limited to assessing uncertainty only for order or distance, but not both simultaneously. We derive the asymptotic joint distribution of maximum composite likelihood estimators for intermarker distances. This approach allows us to construct hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for simultaneously assessing marker-order instability and distance uncertainty. We investigate the effects of marker density, population size, and founder distribution patterns on map confidence in multiparental populations through simulations. Using these data, we provide guidelines on sample sizes necessary to map markers at sub-centimorgan densities with high certainty. We apply these approaches to data from a bread wheat Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population genotyped using the Illumina 9K SNP chip to assess regions of uncertainty and validate them against the recently released pseudomolecule for the wheat chromosome 3B.},

  abstract = {Animal domestication is considered a complex and multistage process that altered behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically the domesticates relative to their wild ancestors. Ever since Darwin, scientists have been concerned about the history of domestication. To determine the domestication origins of the species, it is crucial to discover their ancestors and identify the approximate local domestication. Domestication has been the focus of several studies from different specialties. Studying when, where, and how domestication happened is essential to understand the origins of civilizations and the evolution of domesticated species. The development of both humans and domestic animals is hard to justify, and the genetic variations that occurred during the early animal domestication process remain vague. The recent and potential applications of evolutionary biology may deliver answers for main social challenges. It is important to examine the relationship among the environment and the traits of organisms that have been influenced through the adaptation to modern environments and the patterns of selection triggered by their environments during domestication period. Once domestication occurred, several events such as gene flow and selective pressures occurred, leading to genomic and phenotypic alterations. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about the spatiotemporal outlines of domestication and debates surrounding the intent, speed, and evolutionary landscapes of this event. We also focus on the core challenges for future research. In conclusion, we argue that although the current growth in domestication information has been remarkable, the next era will produce even more significant insights into not only how domestication occurred but also where and when it did so.},

  abstract = {Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs are today recognized as a new class of regulatory molecules despite very little is known about their functions in the cell. Due to their overall low level of expression and tissue-specificity, their identification and annotation in many genomes remains challenging. In this study, we exploited recent annotations provided by the GENCODE project to characterize the genomic and splicing features of lnc-genes in comparison to protein-coding (pc) ones, both in human and mouse. Our analysis highlighted slight differences between the two classes of genes in terms of genome organization and gene architecture. Significant differences in the splice sites usage were observed between lnc- and pc-genes. While the frequency of non-canonical GC-AG splice junctions represents about 0.8\% of total splice sites in pc-genes, we identified a remarkable enrichment of the GC-AG splice sites in lnc-genes, both in human (3.0\%) and mouse (1.9\%). In addition, we found a positional bias of GC-AG splice sites being enriched in the first intron in both classes of genes. Moreover, a significant shorter length and weaker splice sites were found comparing GC-AG introns with the canonical GT-AG introns. The computational analysis of GC-AG splice sites strength revealed a strong reduction in both the donor and the acceptor splice sites scores especially in lnc first intron in both species. Genes containing at least one GC-AG intron were found conserved in many species and a functional enrichment analysis pointed toward their enrichment in specific biological processes. Furthermore, as previously suggested, GC-AG-containing genes were shown to be more prone to alternative splicing. Taken together, our study suggested that GCAG introns could represent new regulatory elements mainly associated with lnc-genes.},

  abstract = {The PRDM9 protein determines sites of meiotic recombination in humans by directing meiotic DNA double-strand breaks to specific loci. Targeting specificity is encoded by a long array of C               2               H               2               zinc fingers that bind to DNA. This zinc finger array is hypervariable, and the resulting alleles each have a potentially different DNA binding preference. The assessment of               PRDM9               diversity is important for understanding the complexity of human population genetics, inheritance linkage patterns, and predisposition to genetic disease. Due to the repetitive nature of the               PRDM9               zinc finger array, the large-scale sequencing of human               PRDM9               is challenging. We, therefore, developed a long-read sequencing strategy to infer the diploid               PRDM9               zinc finger array genotype in a high-throughput manner. From an unbiased study of               PRDM9               allelic diversity in 720 individuals from seven human populations, we detected 69               PRDM9               alleles. Several alleles differ in frequency among human populations, and 32 alleles had not been identified by previous studies, which were heavily biased to European populations.               PRDM9               alleles are distinguished by their DNA binding site preferences and fall into two major categories related to the most common               PRDM9-A               and               PRDM9-C               alleles. We also found that it is likely that inter-conversion between allele types is rare. By mapping meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the testis, we found that small variations in               PRDM9               can substantially alter the meiotic recombination landscape, demonstrating that minor               PRDM9               variants may play an under-appreciated role in shaping patterns of human recombination. In summary, our data greatly expands knowledge of               PRDM9               diversity in humans.},

Although the rice genome serves as an essential tool for biological research, little is known about the evolution of the other Oryza genome types. They contain a historical record of genomic changes that led to diversification of this genus around the world as well as an untapped reservoir of agriculturally important traits. To investigate the evolution of the collective Oryza genome, we sequenced and compared nine orthologous genomic regions encompassing the Adh1-Adh2 genes (from six diploid genome types) with the rice reference sequence. Our analysis revealed the architectural complexities and dynamic evolution of this region that have occurred over the past {$\sim$}15 million years. Of the 46 intact genes and four pseudogenes in the japonica genome, 38 (76\%) fell into eight multigene families. Analysis of the evolutionary history of each family revealed independent and lineage-specific gain and loss of gene family members as frequent causes of synteny disruption. Transposable elements were shown to mediate massive replacement of intergenic space (\&gt;95\%), gene disruption, and gene/gene fragment movement. Three cases of long-range structural variation (inversions/deletions) spanning several hundred kilobases were identified that contributed significantly to genome diversification.},

  abstract = {Genomic resources for hundreds of species of evolutionary, agricultural, economic, and medical importance are unavailable due to the expense of well-assembled genome sequences and difficulties with multigenerational studies. Teleost fish provide many models for human disease but possess anciently duplicated genomes that sometimes obfuscate connectivity. Genomic information representing a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost genome duplication (TGD) would provide an outgroup for exploring the mechanisms of evolution after whole-genome duplication. We exploited massively parallel DNA sequencing to develop meiotic maps with thrift and speed by genotyping F1 offspring of a single female and a single male spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) collected directly from nature utilizing only polymorphisms existing in these two wild individuals. Using Stacks, software that automates the calling of genotypes from polymorphisms assayed by Illumina sequencing, we constructed a map containing 8406 markers. RNAseq on two map-cross larvae provided a reference transcriptome that identified nearly 1000 mapped protein-coding markers and allowed genome-wide analysis of conserved synteny. Results showed that the gar lineage diverged from teleosts before the TGD and its genome is organized more similarly to that of humans than teleosts. Thus, spotted gar provides a critical link between medical models in teleost fish, to which gar is biologically similar, and humans, to which gar is genomically similar. Application of our F1 dense mapping strategy to species with no prior genome information promises to facilitate comparative genomics and provide a scaffold for ordering the numerous contigs arising from next generation genome sequencing.},

  abstract = {Significance             In many eukaryotes, two types of meiotic crossovers (COs) coexist: class I COs that show CO interference and class II COs that do not show interference. Little is known about the separate properties of these two CO pathways or their interaction in wild-type organisms because individual COs cannot be assigned by class using marker segregation. We present an improved cytogenetic approach to identify COs from each class simultaneously on tomato meiotic chromosomes to reveal that the two CO classes have different distributions, with class II COs enriched in short arms and heterochromatin. Although class II CO distributions are consistent with no interference, interference between the two pathways was detected, with suppression of close class I and class II COs.           ,              Crossovers (COs) shuffle genetic information and allow balanced segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first division of meiosis. In several organisms, mutants demonstrate that two molecularly distinct pathways produce COs. One pathway produces class I COs that exhibit interference (lowered probability of nearby COs), and the other pathway produces class II COs with little or no interference. However, the relative contributions, genomic distributions, and interactions of these two pathways are essentially unknown in nonmutant organisms because marker segregation only indicates that a CO has occurred, not its class type. Here, we combine the efficiency of light microscopy for revealing cellular functions using fluorescent probes with the high resolution of electron microscopy to localize and characterize COs in the same sample of meiotic pachytene chromosomes from wild-type tomato. To our knowledge, for the first time, every CO along each chromosome can be identified by class to unveil specific characteristics of each pathway. We find that class I and II COs have different recombination profiles along chromosomes. In particular, class II COs, which represent about 18\% of all COs, exhibit no interference and are disproportionately represented in pericentric heterochromatin, a feature potentially exploitable in plant breeding. Finally, our results demonstrate that the two pathways are not independent because there is interference between class I and II COs.},

Although their functions are not yet clear, ENs may have roles in synapsis and recombination. Here we report on the frequency and distribution of ENs in zygotene SC spreads from six plant species that include one lower vascular plant, two dicots, and three monocots. For each species, the number of ENs per unit length is higher for SC segments than for (asynapsed) axial elements (AEs). In addition, EN number is strongly correlated with SC segment length. There are statistically significant differences in EN frequencies on SCs between species, but these differences are not related to genome size, number of chromosomes, or phylogenetic class. There is no difference in the frequency of ENs per unit length of SC from early to late zygotene. The distribution of distances between adjacent ENs on SC segments is random for all six species, but ENs are found at synaptic forks more often than expected for a random distribution of ENs on SCs. From these observations, we conclude that in plants: (1) some ENs bind to AEs prior to synapsis, (2) most ENs bind to forming SCs at synaptic forks, and (3) ENs do not bind to already formed SCs.},

The present study explores an ex situ conservation collection, the USDA germplasm collection, genotyped at 32,416 SNPs to identify population structure and test for associations with bioclimatic and biophysical variables in Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of Glycine max (soybean).

  abstract = {Genetic linkage maps reveal the order of markers based on the frequency of recombination between markers during meiosis. Because the rate of recombination varies along chromosomes, it has been difficult to relate linkage maps to chromosome structure. Here we use cytological maps of crossing over based on recombination nodules (RNs) to predict the physical position of genetic markers on each of the 10 chromosomes of maize. This is possible because (1) all 10 maize chromosomes can be individually identified from spreads of synaptonemal complexes, (2) each RN corresponds to one crossover, and (3) the frequency of RNs on defined chromosomal segments can be converted to centimorgan values. We tested our predictions for chromosome 9 using seven genetically mapped, single-copy markers that were independently mapped on pachytene chromosomes using in situ hybridization. The correlation between predicted and observed locations was very strong (r2 œ≠ 0.996), indicating a virtual 1:1 correspondence. Thus, this new, high-resolution, cytogenetic map enables one to predict the chromosomal location of any genetically mapped marker in maize with a high degree of accuracy. This novel approach can be applied to other organisms as well.},

ENs and LNs can be distinguished not only on their time of appearance, but also by such characteristics as shape and size, relative numbers, and association with unsynapsed and/or synapsed chromosomal segments. The function(s) of ENs is not clear, but they may have a role in searching for DNA homology, synapsis, gene conversion and/or crossing over. LNs are well correlated with crossing over.

  abstract = {Duckweeds (Lemnaceae family) are the smallest flowering plants that adapt to the aquatic environment. They are regarded as the promising sustainable feedstock with the characteristics of high starch storage, fast propagation, and global distribution. The duckweed genome size varies 13-fold ranging from 150 Mb in Spirodela polyrhiza to 1,881 Mb in Wolffia arrhiza. With the development of sequencing technology and bioinformatics, five duckweed genomes from Spirodela and Lemna genera are sequenced and assembled. The genome annotations discover that they share similar protein orthologs, whereas the repeat contents could mainly explain the genome size difference. The gene families responsible for cell growth and expansion, lignin biosynthesis, and flowering are greatly contracted. However, the gene family of glutamate synthase has experienced expansion, indicating their significance in ammonia assimilation and nitrogen transport. The transcriptome is comprehensively sequenced for the genera of Spirodela, Landoltia, and Lemna, including various treatments such as abscisic acid, radiation, heavy metal, and starvation. The analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism and the regulatory network would accelerate their applications in the fields of bioenergy and phytoremediation. The comparative genomics has shown that duckweed genomes contain relatively low gene numbers and more contracted gene families, which may be in parallel with their highly reduced morphology with a simple leaf and primary roots. Still, we are waiting for the advancement of the long read sequencing technology to resolve the complex genomes and transcriptomes for unsequenced Wolffiella and Wolffia due to the large genome sizes and the similarity in their polyploidy.},

A total of 25 representative markers (potential QTLs) related to leaf area were identified, and there were genes differentially expressed in large and small leaf samples near these markers. GWAS analysis further verified the reliability of QTL mapping. Thirtyone pairs of newly developed indel markers located near these potential QTLs showed high polymorphism and had good discrimination between large and small leaf tea plant samples.

Several methods for estimating recombination rates from segregating polymorphisms in natural populations have recently been developed. These methods have been extensively used in part because they are relatively simple to implement even in many non-model organisms, but also because they potentially offer higher resolution than traditional map-based methods. However, thorough comparisons of LD and map-based estimates of recombination are not readily available in plants. Here we present a new, highresolution linkage map for Populus tremula and use this to estimate variation in recombination rates across the P. tremula genome. We compare these results to recombination rates estimated based on linkage disequilibrium in a large number of unrelated individuals. We also assess how variation in recombination rates is associated with genomic features, such as gene density, repeat density and methylation levels. We find that recombination rates obtained from the two methods largely agree, although the LD-based method identify a number of genomic regions with very high recombination rates that the map-based method fail to detect. Linkage map and LD-based estimates of recombination rates are positively correlated and show similar correlations with other genomic features, showing that both methods can accurately infer recombination rate variation across the genome.},

Five quantitative yield traits, lateral fruitfulness, harvest date and three nut traits (shell thickness, nut weight and kernel fill) were then mapped on to linkage groups. A significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) in LG 11 with negative additive effects suggested heterozygote superiority in the expression of lateral bearing.

Shell thickness, nut weight and kernel fill were under the control of two to three linked pleiotropic QTLs in LG 1 segregating from ``Idaho.''

  abstract = {Meiosis is a potentially important source of germline mutations, as sites of meiotic recombination experience recurrent double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, evidence for a local mutagenic effect of recombination from population sequence data has been equivocal, likely because mutation is only one of several forces shaping sequence variation. By sequencing large numbers of single crossover molecules obtained from human sperm for two recombination hotspots, we find direct evidence that recombination is mutagenic: Crossovers carry more de novo mutations than nonrecombinant DNA molecules analyzed for the same donors and hotspots. The observed mutations were primarily CG to TA transitions, with a higher frequency of transitions at CpG than non-CpGs sites. This enrichment of mutations at CpG sites at hotspots could predominate in methylated regions involving frequent single-stranded DNA processing as part of DSB repair. In addition, our data set provides evidence that GC alleles are preferentially transmitted during crossing over, opposing mutation, and shows that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) predominates over mutation in the sequence evolution of hotspots. These findings are consistent with the idea that gBGC could be an adaptation to counteract the mutational load of recombination.},

Antibodies specific to Asy1 protein and its homologue BoAsy1 from the related crop species Brassica oleracea have been used to investigate the temporal expression and localization of the protein in both species. Asy1 is initially detected in pollen mother cells during meiotic interphase as numerous punctate foci distributed over the chromatin. As leptotene progresses the signal appears to be increasingly continuous and is closely associated with the axial elements but not to the extended chromatin loops associated with them. By the end of zygotene the signal extends almost the entire length of the synapsed homologues, although not to the telomeres. The protein begins to disappear as the homologues desynapse, until by late diplotene it is no longer associated with the chromosomes. Immunogold labelling in conjunction with electron microscopy established that Asy1 localizes to regions of chromatin that associate with the axial/lateral elements of meiotic chromosomes rather than being a component of the synaptonemal complex itself. These data together with the previously observed asynaptic phenotype of the asy1 mutant suggest that Asy1 is required for morphogenesis of the synaptonemal complex, possibly by defining regions of chromatin that associate with the developing synaptonemal complex structure.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination plays a crucial role in plant breeding through the creation of new allelic combinations. Therefore, lack of recombination in some genomic regions constitutes a constraint for breeding programmes. In sugar beet, one of the major crops in Europe, recombination occurs mainly in the distal portions of the chromosomes, and so the development of simple approaches to change this pattern is of considerable interest for future breeding and genetics. In the present study, the effect of heat stress on recombination in sugar beet was studied by treating F1 plants at 28 {\textdegree}C/25 {\textdegree}C (day/night) and genotyping the progeny. F1 plants were reciprocally backcrossed allowing the study of male and female meiosis separately. Genotypic data indicated an overall increase in crossover frequency of approximately one extra crossover per meiosis, with an associated increase in pericentromeric recombination under heat treatment. Our data indicate that the changes were mainly induced by alterations in female meiosis only, showing that heterochiasmy in sugar beet is reduced under heat stress. Overall, despite the associated decrease in fertility, these data support the potential use of heat stress to foster recombination in sugar beet breeding programmes.},

Materials and methods A consensus map of lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris Medikus) was constructed using three different lentils recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, including ``CDC Redberry'' x ``ILL7502'' (LR8), ``ILL8006'' x ``CDC Milestone'' (LR11) and ``PI320937'' x ``Eston'' (LR39). Results The lentil consensus map was composed of 9,793 DArT markers, covered a total of 977.47 cM with an average distance of 0.10 cM between adjacent markers and constructed 7 linkage groups representing 7 chromosomes of the lentil genome. The consensus map had no gap larger than 12.67 cM and only 5 gaps were found to be between 12.67 cM and 6.0 cM (on LG3 and LG4). The localization of the SNP markers on the lentil consensus map were in general consistent with their localization on the three individual genetic linkage maps and the lentil consensus map has longer map length, higher marker density and shorter average distance between the adjacent markers compared to the component linkage maps. Conclusion This high-density consensus map could provide insight into the lentil genome. The consensus map could also help to construct a physical map using a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome},

Thus, changes in recombination hotspots may influence speciation. To investigate the variation in recombination processes in humans and their closest existing relatives,                                Auton                 et al.

While rates of recombination are comparable between humans and chimpanzees, the locations and genetic motifs associated with recombination differ between the species.                        ,              Chimpanzees show similar genetic recombination rates as humans but differ in the genomic regions involved.           ,                             To study the evolution of recombination rates in apes, we developed methodology to construct a fine-scale genetic map from high-throughput sequence data from 10 Western chimpanzees,               Pan troglodytes verus               . Compared to the human genetic map, broad-scale recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal rearrangements and around the site of ancestral fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales, chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots, which show no overlap with those of humans even though rates are similarly elevated around CpG islands and decreased within genes. The hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive variation among Western chimpanzees, and there is little evidence that any sequence motifs are enriched in hotspots. The contrasting locations of hotspots provide a natural experiment, which demonstrates the impact of recombination on base composition.},

  abstract = {The identification of the H3K4 trimethylase, PRDM9, as the gene responsible for recombination hotspot localization has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in mammals. However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9 and may therefore provide a model for understanding recombination that occurs in the absence of PRDM9, and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the recombination landscape. We have constructed a fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. While broad-scale properties of recombination appear similar to other mammalian species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that canine highly elevated recombination rates are observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions including gene promoter regions, but show little association with H3K4 trimethylation marks identified in spermatocytes. By comparison to genomic data from the Andean fox, Lycalopex culpaeus, we show that biased gene conversion is a plausible mechanism by which the high CpG content of the dog genome could have occurred.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Recombination rates vary considerably at the fine scale within mammalian genomes, with the majority of recombination occurring within hotspots of {\textasciitilde}2 kb in width. We present a method for inferring the location of recombination hotspots from patterns of linkage disequilibrium within samples of population genetic data. Results: Using simulations, we show that our method has hotspot detection power of approximately 50-60\%, but depending on the magnitude of the hotspot. The false positive rate is between 0.24 and 0.56 false positives per Mb for data typical of humans. Availability: http://github.com/auton1/LDhot},

  abstract = {In many species, meiotic recombination events tend to occur in narrow intervals of the genome, known as hotspots. In humans and mice, double strand break (DSB) hotspot locations are determined by the DNA-binding specificity of the zinc finger array of the PRDM9 protein, which is rapidly evolving at residues in contact with DNA. Previous models explained this rapid evolution in terms of the need to restore PRDM9 binding sites lost to gene conversion over time, under the assumption that more PRDM9 binding always leads to more DSBs. In recent experimental work, however, it has become apparent that PRDM9 binding on both homologs facilitates DSB repair, and moreover that, in the absence of enough symmetric binding, meiosis no longer progresses reliably. We therefore consider the possibility that the benefit of PRDM9 stems from its role in coupling DSB formation and efficient repair. To this end, we model the evolution of PRDM9 from first principles: from its binding dynamics to the population processes that govern the evolution of the zinc finger array and its binding sites in the genome. As we show, the loss of a small number of strong binding sites leads to the use of a greater number of weaker ones, resulting in a sharp reduction in symmetric binding and favoring new PRDM9 alleles that restore the use of a smaller set of strong binding sites. This decrease in PRDM9 binding symmetry and in its ability to promote DSB repair drive the rapid zinc finger turnover. These results imply that the advantage of new PRDM9 alleles is in limiting the number of binding sites used effectively, rather than in increasing net PRDM9 binding, as previously believed. By extension, our model suggests that the evolutionary advantage of hotspots may have been to increase the efficiency of DSB repair and/or homolog pairing.},

Here, we identify PRDM9 orthologs from genome and transcriptome data in 225 species. We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs.           ,              The genetic information of Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants and fungi) is encoded on strands of DNA called chromosomes. In animals that sexually reproduce, most cells carry two copies of each chromosome, with one inherited from each of their parents. Sex cells such as sperm and egg cells are the exception, and contain only a paternal or maternal set respectively. These chromosomes are not exact copies of the parental chromosomes, but are instead combinations of both of them, generated by a process called meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination begins by breaking the chromosomes, and the repair of those breaks shuffles DNA segments between the two chromosomes. This shuffling is known as a ``recombination event''.             In humans, apes and mice, the location of recombination events depends on where a protein called PRDM9 binds to the DNA. Over the course of evolution, this binding location has changed relatively rapidly so that even closely related species such as humans and chimpanzees localize recombination events to different DNA regions. In contrast, closely related species that do not produce PRDM9 tend to direct recombination events to similar DNA regions.             It remains unclear when PRDM9 first evolved its role in recombination, or why different methods of directing recombination have developed. To begin answering these questions, Baker, Schumer et al. investigated whether 225 species of vertebrates (backboned animals) have a gene that encodes PRDM9. This analysis revealed that even distantly related animals have genes that produce equivalents of the complete PRDM9 protein. However, several species have independently lost the ability to produce PRDM9. In certain other species, particular regions of the gene have been removed or shortened. Notably, only species that carry genes that contain regions called the KRAB and SSXRD domains show relatively rapid evolution of where PRDM9 binds in the DNA.             To investigate this phenomenon further, Baker, Schumer et al. constructed a map of recombination events in swordtail fish, which carry a version of the gene that lacks the KRAB and SSXRD domains. The PRDM9 protein produced by this gene does not direct where recombination events occur.             Overall, it appears that the KRAB and SSXRD domains are necessary for PRDM9 to direct meiotic recombination. Furthermore, Baker, Schumer et al. predict that those species that have complete versions of PRDM9 use this protein to localize recombination events. Knowing which species use PRDM9 in this way is the first step towards understanding why recombination mechanisms change in evolution, and with what consequences.},

Onion is an example of an under-researched crop with a complex, heterozygous genome where genome-based research has previously been hindered by limited sequence resources and genetic markers.                                         Results                                We report the development of generic tools for large-scale web-based PCR-based marker design in the Galaxy bioinformatics framework, and their application for development of next-generation genetics resources in a wide cross of bulb onion (                 Allium cepa                 L.). Transcriptome sequence resources were developed for the homozygous doubled-haploid bulb onion line `CUDH2150' and the genetically distant Indian landrace `Nasik Red', using 454{\texttrademark} sequencing of normalised cDNA libraries of leaf and shoot. Read mapping of `Nasik Red' reads onto `CUDH2150' assemblies revealed 16836 indel and SNP polymorphisms that were mined for portable PCR-based marker development. Tools for detection of restriction polymorphisms and primer set design were developed in BioPython and adapted for use in the Galaxy workflow environment, enabling large-scale and targeted assay design. Using PCR-based markers designed with these tools, a framework genetic linkage map of over 800cM spanning all chromosomes was developed in a subset of 93 F                 2                 progeny from a very large F                 2                 family developed from the `Nasik Red' x `CUDH2150' inter-cross. The utility of tools and genetic resources developed was tested by designing markers to transcription factor-like polymorphic sequences. Bin mapping these markers using a subset of 10 progeny confirmed the ability to place markers within 10 cM bins, enabling increased efficiency in marker assignment and targeted map refinement. The major genetic loci conditioning red bulb colour (                 R                 ) and fructan content (                 Frc                 ) were located on this map by QTL analysis.                                                        Conclusions               The generic tools developed for the Galaxy environment enable rapid development of sets of PCR assays targeting sequence variants identified from Illumina and 454 sequence data. They enable non-specialist users to validate and exploit large volumes of next-generation sequence data using basic equipment.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic correlations were calculated and the levels of phenotypic integration of three congeneric species, annual Lamium purpureum and perennial Lamium album and Lamium maculatum, were estimated. Calculations were performed separately for different stages of development during transplantation under different density and light treatments. L. purpureum exhibited greater integration in comparison to the other two species before exposure to environmental treatments, as well as greater variability in phenotypic correlations in response to light and density. The perennial species possessed similar correlation patterns in comparison to annual L. purpureum, becoming more similar to L. purpureum at later stages of development. The effects of density and light intensity were dependent on the specific combination of factors, as well as on the species under study. Density effects in L. purpureum were also habitat- and population-specific. A greater difference in response to density treatments between habitats than between populations was detected. Overall, phenotypes become more integrated during ontogeny, while dissimilarities in phenotypic correlations among species and between populations were more related to ecological than to phylogenetic differences.},

Many linkage group termini also have clusters, though involving fewer loci. We examine the factors shaping the genetic map by analyzing the rate of recombination and gene density across the genome using the positions of cloned genes and random cDNA clones from the physical map. Each chromosome has a central gene-dense region (more diffuse on the X) with discrete boundaries, flanked by gene-poor regions. Only autosomes have reduced rates of recombination in these gene-dense regions. Cluster boundaries appear discrete also by recombination rate, and the boundaries defined by recombination rate and gene density mostly, but not always, coincide. Terminal clusters have greater gene densities than the adjoining arm but similar recombination rates. Thus, unlike in other species, most exchange in C. elegans occurs in gene-poor regions. The recombination rate across each cluster is constant and similar; and cluster size and gene number per chromosome are independent of the physical size of chromosomes. We propose a model of how this genome organization arose.},

Since statistical inference of recombination maps typically depends on large samples, reaching out studies to non-model organisms requires alternative tools. Here we extend the sequentially Markovian coalescent model to jointly infer demography and the variation in recombination along a pair of genomes. Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenarios {\textendash} remarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of archaic hominids. We report that the evolution of the recombination landscape follows the established phylogeny of Neandertals, Denisovans and modern human populations, as expected if the genomic distribution of crossovers in hominids is largely neutral.},

Attempts to answer this question have sparked debate about the roles of neutral stochastic processes and natural selection in molecular evolution. However, the mechanisms of evolution do not act in isolation, and integrative models that simultaneously consider the influence of multiple factors on 30 diversity are lacking; without them, confounding factors lurk in the estimates. Here we present a new statistical method that jointly infers the genomic landscapes of genealogies, recombination rates and mutation rates. In doing so, our model captures the effects of genetic drift, linked selection and local mutation rates on patterns of genomic variation. Guided by our causal model, we use linear regression to estimate the individual contributions of these micro-evolutionary forces to 35 levels of nucleotide diversity. Our analyses reveal the signature of selection in Drosophila melanogaster, but we estimate that the mutation landscape is the major driver of the distribution of diversity in this species. Furthermore, our simulation study suggests that in many evolutionary scenarios the mutation landscape will be a crucial force shaping diversity, depending notably on the genomic window size used in the analysis. We argue that incorporating mutation rate variation into 40 the null model of molecular evolution will lead to more realistic inference in population genomics.},

  abstract = {In regions of suppressed recombination, where selection is expected to be less efficient in removing slightly deleterious mutations, transposable element (TE) insertions should be more likely to drift to higher frequencies, and even to reach fixation. In the absence of excision events, once a TE is fixed it cannot be eliminated from the population, and accumulation of elements thus should become an irreversible process. In the long term, this can drive the degeneration of large non-recombining fractions of the genomes. Chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster has very low levels of recombination, if any, and this could be causing its degeneration. Here we report the results of a PCR-based analysis of the population frequencies of TE insertions in a sample from three African natural populations. We investigated 27 insertions from 12 TE families, located in regions of either suppressed or free recombination. Our results suggest that TE insertions tend to be fixed in the non-recombining regions, particularly on the fourth chromosome. We have also found that this involves all types of elements, and that fixed insertions are significantly shorter and more divergent from the canonical sequence than those segregating in the sample (28.1\% vs 86.3\% of the canonical length, and average nucleotide divergence (DXY)=0.082 vs 0.008, respectively). Finally, DNA-based elements seem to show a greater tendency to reach fixation than retrotransposons. Implications of these findings for the population dynamics of TEs, and the evolutionary forces that shape the patterns of genetic variation in regions of reduced recombination, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Understanding the determinants of genomic base composition is fundamental to understanding genome evolution. GC biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a key driving force behind genomic GC content, through the preferential incorporation of GC alleles over AT alleles during recombination, driving them towards fixation. The majority of work on gBGC has focussed on its role in coding regions, largely to address how it confounds estimates of selection. Non-coding regions have received less attention, particularly in regard to the interaction of gBGC and the effective population size (                            N               e                          ) within and between species. To address this, we investigate how the strength of gBGC (             B             = 4                            N               e               b                          , where             b             is the conversion bias) varies within the non-coding genome of two wild passerines. We use a dataset of published high coverage genomes (10 great tits and 10 zebra finches) to estimate             B             , nucleotide diversity, changes in                            N               e                          , and crossover rates from linkage maps, in 1Mb homologous windows in each species. We demonstrate remarkable conservation of both             B             and crossover rate between species. We show that the mean strength of gBGC in the zebra finch is more than double that in the great tit, consistent with its twofold greater effective population size.             B             also correlates with both crossover rate and nucleotide diversity in each species. Finally, we estimate equilibrium GC content from both divergence and polymorphism data, which indicates that             B             has been increasing in both species, and provide support for population expansion explaining a large proportion of this increase in the zebra finch.                                   Significance statement             Understanding the forces that change the nucleotide base composition of genomes is central to understanding their evolution. One such force is GC biased gene conversion, a process that during recombination converts some heterozygous base positions to homozygous. This process is more likely to convert adenine and thymine bases to guanine and cytosine bases than the other way around, hence is GC biased. This increases the frequency of GC alleles in a way similar to positive selection. This process has largely been studied within protein coding regions, and not often compared between species. We measure its strength in the non-coding areas of the genomes of two bird species, showing it to be stronger in the species with the larger population size.},

  abstract = {Summary                            A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (               s                                i                              ) on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria ({$\upsilon$}               1               {$<$} 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) (               V               {${'}$}               2               ,               V               {${'}$}               3               ,.. epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis,               s                                i                              = - ({$\upsilon$}               1               + 4               V               2               /3){$\delta$}               r               , where {$\delta$}               r               is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

Bird genomes lack the protein PRDM9, a key determinant of recombination dynamics in most metazoans. The historical recombination maps in birds show an apparent stasis in the positioning of recombination events. This highly conserved recombination pattern over long timescales should constrain the evolution of recombination in birds, but extensive variation in recombination rate across the genome and between different species has been reported. Here, we characterise a fine-scale historical recombination map of an iconic migratory songbird, the European blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) using a LD-based approach which accounts for population demography. We found variable recombination rates among and within chromosomes, which associate positively with nucleotide diversity and GC content, and a negatively with chromosome size. The recombination rates increased significantly at regulatory regions and not necessarily at high-dense gene regions. CpG islands associated strongly with recombination rates; however, their specific position and local DNA methylation patterns likely influenced this relationship. The association with retrotransposons varied according to specific family and location. Our results also provide evidence of a heterogeneous conservation of recombination maps between the blackcap and its closest sister taxon, the garden warbler at the intra-chromosomal level. These findings highlight the considerable variability of recombination rates at different scales and the role of specific genomic features at shaping this variation. This study opens the possibility of further investigating the impact of recombination in specific population-genomic features.},

Here we provide an in-depth study of crossover interference in Arabidopsis thaliana, examining crossovers genome-wide in .1500 backcrosses for both male and female meiosis. This unique data set allows us to take a two-pathway modeling approach based on superposing a fraction p of noninterfering crossovers and a fraction (1 2 p) of interfering crossovers generated using the gamma model characterized by its interference strength nu. Within this framework, we fit the two-pathway model to the data and compare crossover interference strength between chromosomes and then along chromosomes. We find that the interfering pathway has markedly higher interference strength nu in female than in male meiosis and also that male meiosis has a higher proportion p of noninterfering crossovers. Furthermore, we test for possible intrachromosomal variations of nu and p. Our conclusion is that there are clear differences between left and right arms as well as between central and peripheral regions. Finally, statistical tests unveil a genome-wide picture of small-scale heterogeneities, pointing to the existence of hot regions in the genome where crossovers form preferentially without interference.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} In this work, we performed simulations to explore the potential of manipulating recombination rates to increase response to selection in livestock breeding programs. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} We carried out ten replicates of several scenarios that followed a common overall structure but differed in the average rate of recombination along the genome (expressed as the length of a chromosome in Morgan), the genetic architecture of the trait under selection, and the selection intensity under truncation selection (expressed as the proportion of males selected). Recombination rates were defined by simulating nine different chromosome lengths: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 Morgan, respectively. One Morgan was considered to be the typical chro-mosome length for current livestock species. The genetic architecture was defined by the number of quantitative trait variants (QTV) that affected the trait under selection. Either a large (10,000) or a small (1000 or 500) number of QTV was simulated. Finally, the proportions of males selected under truncation selection as sires for the next generation were equal to 1.2, 2.4, 5, or 10 \%. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Increasing recombination rate increased the overall response to selection and decreased the loss of genetic variance. The difference in cumulative response between low and high recombination rates increased over genera-tions. At low recombination rates, cumulative response to selection tended to asymptote sooner and the genetic vari-ance was completely eroded. If the trait under selection was affected by few QTV, differences between low and high recombination rates still existed, but the selection limit was reached at all rates of recombination. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Higher recombination rates can enhance the efficiency of breeding programs to turn genetic varia-tion into response to selection. However, to increase response to selection significantly, the recombination rate would need to be increased 10- or 20-fold. The biological feasibility and consequences of such large increases in recombina-tion rates are unknown.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, a programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) leads to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. These exchanges increase genome diversity and are essential for proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division. Recent findings have highlighted an unexpected molecular control of the distribution of meiotic DSBs in mammals by a rapidly evolving gene, PR domain-containing 9 (PRDM9), and genome-wide analyses have facilitated the characterization of meiotic DSB sites at unprecedented resolution. In addition, the identification of new players in DSB repair processes has allowed the delineation of recombination pathways that have two major outcomes, crossovers and non-crossovers, which have distinct mechanistic roles and consequences for genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Homing in on Hotspots                            The clustering of recombination in the genome, around locations known as hotspots, is associated with specific DNA motifs. Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by                                Cheung                 et al.                              ).                                Parvanov                 et al.                              (p.               835               , published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas                                Myers                 et al.                              (p.               876               , published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome.                                Baudat                 et al.                              (p.               836               , published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species.                        ,              A chromatin-modifying enzyme is implicated in the determination of recombination loci within the genome.           ,                             Meiotic recombination events cluster into narrow segments of the genome, defined as hotspots. Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the               Prdm9               gene. First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome.},

  abstract = {We report on a whole-genome draft sequence of rye (Secale cereale L.). Rye is a diploid Triticeae species closely related to wheat and barley, and an important crop for food and feed in Central and Eastern Europe. Through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the 7.9-Gbp genome of the winter rye inbred line Lo7 we obtained a de novo assembly represented by 1.29 million scaffolds covering a total length of 2.8 Gbp. Our reference sequence represents nearly the entire low-copy portion of the rye genome. This genome assembly was used to predict 27 784 rye gene models based on homology to sequenced grass genomes. Through resequencing of 10 rye inbred lines and one accession of the wild relative S. vavilovii, we discovered more than 90 million single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions in the rye genome. From these variants, we developed the high-density Rye600k genotyping array with 600 843 markers, which enabled anchoring the sequence contigs along a high-density genetic map and establishing a synteny-based virtual gene order. Genotyping data were used to characterize the diversity of rye breeding pools and genetic resources, and to obtain a genome-wide map of selection signals differentiating the divergent gene pools. This rye whole-genome sequence closes a gap in Triticeae genome research, and will be highly valuable for comparative genomics, functional studies and genome-based breeding in rye.},

Careful examination of meiotic prophase showed the lowering of chiasma frequency to be correlated with failure of zygotene chromosome pairing, justifying the use of the term asynaptic. Observation of the pairing behaviour of an isochromosome in the nullisomic 5D background suggested that the asynapsis was due to a failure in the mechanism of chromosome pairing rather than of the pre-alignment of homologues. The observed effects in the absence of chromosome 5D could be due to the presence of a recessive allele at the locus of chromosome 5A, also known to control stability of chiasma frequency to temperature. In conclusion it is pointed out that in euploid wheat the sensitivity of chiasma frequency to temperatures within the normal meteorological range could influence the cytological stability of the wheat crop.},

  abstract = {Arabidopsis lyrata, a close relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, is 1 of a few plant species for which the genome is to be entirely sequenced, which promises to yield important insights into genome evolution. Only 2 sparse linkage maps have been published, and these were based solely on markers derived from the A. thaliana genome. Because the genome of A. lyrata is practically twice as large as that of A. thaliana, the extent of map coverage of the A. lyrata genome remains uncertain. In this study, a 2-way pseudo-testcross strategy was used to construct genetic linkage maps of A. lyrata subsp. petraea and A. lyrata subsp. lyrata, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers from the A. thaliana genome, and anonymous amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers that could potentially uncover regions unique to the A. lyrata genome. The SSR and CAPS markers largely confirmed the relationships between linkage groups in A. lyrata and A. thaliana. AFLP markers slightly increased the coverage of the A. lyrata maps, but mostly increased marker density on the linkage groups. We noted a much lower level of polymorphism and a greater segregation distortion in A. lyrata subsp. lyrata markers. The implications of these findings for the sequencing of the A. lyrata genome are discussed.

It is very general that there are no sufficient polymorphic markers to construct linkage map and ineffective to conduct markerassisted selection (MAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping based on lower density linkage map. This study proposed a method for developing genetic linkage map based on a fourway cross population. Computer simulation was conducted to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method and a supporting program was designed. The main procedures and features of the proposed method were summarized as follows: 1) estimating genetic distance of any paired markers based on maximum likelihood method; 2) splitting all markers into different groups (linkage group) by cluster analysis based on genetic distance of markers; 3) for each linkage group, two end markers were first determined, then the marker order could be determined by inserting other markers in appropriate position by distance analysis of any three neighboring markers. Monte Carlo simulation showed that the proposed method is feasible, effective, and applicable in other derived populations from crossing of two homogenous parents.},

Common bean (               Phaseolus vulgaris               L.) was introduced in Europe after 1492. Here, by combining whole-genome profiling, metabolic fingerprinting and phenotypic characterisation, we show that the first common bean cultigens successfully introduced into Europe were of Andean origin, after Francisco Pizarro's expedition to northern Peru in 1529. We reveal that hybridisation, selection and recombination have shaped the genomic diversity of the European common bean in parallel with political constraints. There is clear evidence of adaptive introgression into the Mesoamerican-derived European genotypes, with 44 Andean introgressed genomic segments shared by more than 90\% of European accessions and distributed across all chromosomes except PvChr11. Genomic scans for signatures of selection highlight the role of genes relevant to flowering and environmental adaptation, suggesting that introgression has been crucial for the dissemination of this tropical crop to the temperate regions of Europe.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Most eukaryotic genes undergo alternative splicing (AS), but the overall functional significance of this process remains a controversial issue. It has been noticed that the complexity of organisms correlates positively with their genome-wide AS rate. This has been interpreted as evidence that AS plays an important role in adaptive evolution by increasing the functional repertoires of genomes. However, this observation also fits with a totally opposite interpretation: given that `complex' organisms tend to have small effective population sizes (             N             e             ), they are expected to be more affected by genetic drift, and hence more prone to accumulate deleterious mutations that decrease splicing accuracy. Thus, according to this ``drift barrier'' theory, the elevated AS rate in complex organisms might simply result from a higher splicing error rate. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of 3,496 transcriptome sequencing samples to quantify AS in 53 metazoan species spanning a wide range of             N             e             values. Our results show a negative correlation between             N             e             proxies and the genome-wide AS rates among species, consistent with the drift barrier hypothesis. This pattern is dominated by low abundance isoforms, which represent the vast majority of the splice variant repertoire. We show that these low abundance isoforms are depleted in functional AS events, and most likely correspond to errors. Conversely, the AS rate of abundant isoforms, which are relatively enriched in functional AS events, tends to be lower in more complex species. All these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in AS rates across metazoans reflects the limits set by drift on the capacity of selection to prevent gene expression errors.},

Genome size, gene content, gene order, centromere function, and numerous other aspects of nuclear biology are driven by TE activity. Although the origins and attitudes of TEs have the hallmarks of selfish DNA, there are numerous cases where TE components have been co-opted by the host to create new genes or modify gene regulation. In particular, epigenetic regulation has been transformed from a process to silence invading TEs and viruses into a key strategy for regulating plant genes. Most, perhaps all, of this epigenetic regulation is derived from TE insertions near genes or TE-encoded factors that act in trans. Enormous pools of genome data and new technologies for reverse genetics will lead to a powerful new era of TE analysis in plants.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is a dynamic process during which chromosomes undergo condensation, pairing, crossing-over and disjunction. Stringent regulation of the distribution and quantity of meiotic crossovers is critical for proper chromosome segregation in many organisms. In humans, aberrant crossover placement and the failure to faithfully segregate meiotic chromosomes often results in severe genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome. In most sexually reproducing organisms, crossovers are more evenly spaced than would be expected from a random distribution. This phenomenon, termed interference, was first reported in the early 20th century by Drosophila geneticists and has been subsequently observed in a vast range of organisms from yeasts to humans. Yet, many questions regarding the behavior and mechanism of interference remain poorly understood. In this review, we examine results new and old, from a wide range of organisms, to begin to understand the progress and remaining challenges to understanding the fundamental unanswered questions regarding genetic interference.},

Only genetic information present in the germ cells will be inherited by future generations, and any molecular processes affecting the germline genome are therefore likely to be passed on. Despite its prevalence across taxonomic kingdoms, we are only starting to understand details of the underlying micro-evolutionary processes occurring at the germline genome level. These include segregation, recombination, mutation and selection and can occur at any stage during germline differentiation and mitotic germline proliferation to meiosis and post-meiotic gamete maturation. Selection acting on germ cells at any stage from the diploid germ cell to the haploid gametes may cause significant deviations from Mendelian inheritance and may be more widespread than previously assumed. The mechanisms that affect and potentially alter the genomic sequence and allele frequencies in the germline are pivotal to our understanding of heritability. With the rise of new sequencing technologies, we are now able to address some of these unanswered questions. In this review, we comment on the most recent developments in this field and identify current gaps in our knowledge.},

For the purposes of population genetics, clinical genetics, and genetic epidemiology, it is important to harmonize and amalgamate existing genetic and physical maps. Among other things, comparisons of the two kinds of maps promotes better understanding of the wide variation in local recombination rates per unit physical length of DNA. The current paper presents methods for estimating recombination intensity as a function of physical distance along a chromosome. Genetic map distance is the integral of intensity. We derive fast reliable estimation algorithms based on a Poisson process model, penalized likelihoods, and cubic spline interpolation. Our methods provide a rigorous and statistically sound foundation for comparing physical and genetic maps. To illustrate the possibilities, we apply the methods to published recombination data on CEPH families and the complete sequences of chromosomes 21 and 22. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies and the biological data.},

As we discuss here, the wide range of heterogeneities calls for reexamination of an accepted belief, namely that the endogenous DNA of bacteria and archaea should typically exhibit low intrachromosomal GC contrasts. Supplementary results for all species analyzed are available at our website: http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/prok.},

  abstract = {Here we present a study of statistical correlations among different positions in DNA sequences and their implications by directly using the autocorrelation function. Such an analysis is possible now because of the availability of large sequences or even complete genomes of many organisms. After describing the way in which the autocorrelation function can be applied to DNA-sequence analysis, we show that longrange correlations, implying scale independence, appear in several bacterial genomes as well as in long human chromosome contigs. The source for such correlations in bacteria, which may extend up to 60 kb in Bacillus subtilis, may be related to massive lateral transfer of compositionally biased genes from other genomes. In the human genome, correlations extend for more than five decades and may be related to the evolution of the 'neogenome', a modern evolutionary acquisition composed by GC-rich isochores displaying long-range correlations and scale invariance. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Genetic differentiation between divergent populations is often greater in chromosome centers than in chromosome peripheries. Commonly overlooked, this broad-scale differentiation pattern is sometimes ascribed to heterogeneity in crossover rate and hence linked selection within chromosomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A literature survey across 46 organisms reveals that most eukaryotes indeed exhibit a reduced crossover rate in chromosome centers relative to the peripheries. Using simulations of populations diverging into ecologically different habitats through sorting of standing genetic variation, we demonstrate that such chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate, combined with polygenic divergent selection, causes stronger hitchhiking and especially barriers to gene flow across chromosome centers. Without requiring selection on new mutations, this rapidly leads to elevated population differentiation in the low-crossover centers relative to the high-crossover peripheries of chromosomes ('Chromosome Center-Biased Differentiation', CCBD). Using simulated and empirical data, we then show that strong CCBD between populations can provide evidence of polygenic adaptive divergence with gene flow. We further demonstrate that chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate impacts analyses beyond that of population differentiation, including the inference of phylogenies and parallel adaptive evolution among populations, the detection of genetic loci under selection, and the interpretation of the strength of selection on genomic regions. Overall, our results call for a greater appreciation of chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate in evolutionary genomics.},

This genetic map covered 930 cM in seven linkage groups and was based on 463 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers using 17 primer pairs, three isozymes and five EST markers. The average density of markers was approximately 1 per 2.0 cM. However, strong clustering of AFLP markers was observed at putative centromeric regions. Around these regions, 272 markers covered about 137 cM whereas the remaining 199 markers covered approximately 793 cM. Most genetic distances between consecutive pairs of markers were smaller than 20 cM except for five gaps on groups A, C, D, F and G. A skeletal map with a uniform distribution of markers can be extracted from this high-density map, and can be applied to detect and map QTLs. We report here the application of AFLP markers to genome mapping, in Lolium as a prelude to quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification for diverse agronomic traits in ryegrass and for marker-assisted plant breeding.},

  abstract = {Background: The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is a major cultivated crop and the world's largest source of edible vegetable oil. The genus Elaeis comprises two species E. guineensis, the commercial African oil palm and E. oleifera, which is used in oil palm genetic breeding. The recent publication of both the African oil palm genome assembly and the first draft sequence of its Latin American relative now allows us to tackle the challenge of understanding the genome composition, structure and evolution of these palm genomes through the annotation of their repeated sequences. Methods: In this study, we identified, annotated and compared Transposable Elements (TE) from the African and Latin American oil palms. In a first step, Transposable Element databases were built through de novo detection in both genome sequences then the TE content of both genomes was estimated. Then putative full-length retrotransposons with Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) were further identified in the E. guineensis genome for characterization of their structural diversity, copy number and chromosomal distribution. Finally, their relative expression in several tissues was determined through in silico analysis of publicly available transcriptome data. Results: Our results reveal a congruence in the transpositional history of LTR retrotransposons between E. oleifera and E. guineensis, especially the Sto-4 family. Also, we have identified and described 583 full-length LTR-retrotransposons in the Elaeis guineensis genome. Our work shows that these elements are most likely no longer mobile and that no recent insertion event has occurred. Moreover, the analysis of chromosomal distribution suggests a preferential insertion of Copia elements in gene-rich regions, whereas Gypsy elements appear to be evenly distributed throughout the genome. Conclusions: Considering the high proportion of LTR retrotransposon in the oil palm genome, our work will contribute to a greater understanding of their impact on genome organization and evolution. Moreover, the knowledge gained from this study constitutes a valuable resource for both the improvement of genome annotation and the investigation of the evolutionary history of palms.},

  abstract = {The first draft of the honey bee genome sequence and improved genetic maps are utilized to analyze a genome displaying 10 times higher levels of recombination (19 cM/Mb) than previously analyzed genomes of higher eukaryotes. The exceptionally high recombination rate is distributed genome-wide, but varies by two orders of magnitude. Analysis of chromosome, sequence, and gene parameters with respect to recombination showed that local recombination rate is associated with distance to the telomere, GC content, and the number of simple repeats as described for low-recombining genomes. Recombination rate does not decrease with chromosome size. On average 5.7 recombination events per chromosome pair per meiosis are found in the honey bee genome. This contrasts with a wide range of taxa that have a uniform recombination frequency of about 1.6 per chromosome pair. The excess of recombination activity does not support a mechanistic role of recombination in stabilizing pairs of homologous chromosome during chromosome pairing. Recombination rate is associated with gene size, suggesting that introns are larger in regions of low recombination and may improve the efficacy of selection in these regions. Very few transposons and no retrotransposons are present in the high-recombining genome. We propose evolutionary explanations for the exceptionally high genome-wide recombination rate.},

Here we apply the Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) method developed for cereals to the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a peach F2 mapping population. Peach is a genetic and genomic model within the Rosaceae and will provide a template for the use of this method with other members of this family. Our F2 mapping population of 57 genotypes segregates for bloom time (BD) and chilling requirement (CR) and we have extensively phenotyped this population. The population derives from a selfed F1 progeny of a cross between `Hakuho' (high CR) and `UFGold' (low CR). We were able to successfully employ GBS and the TASSEL GBS pipeline without modification of the original methodology using the ApeKI restriction enzyme and multiplexing at an equivalent of 96 samples per Illumina HiSeq 2000 lane. We obtained hundreds of SNP markers which were then used to construct a genetic linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for BD and CR.},

  abstract = {Recombination (R) rate and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses are the basis for plant breeding. These vary by breeding system, by generation of inbreeding or outcrossing and by region in the chromosome. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a favored food legume with a small sequenced genome (514 Mb) and n = 11 chromosomes. The goal of this study was to describe R and LD in the common bean genome using a 768-marker array of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based on Trans-legume Orthologous Group (TOG) genes along with an advanced-generation Recombinant Inbred Line reference mapping population (BAT93 x Jalo EEP558) and an internationally available diversity panel. A whole genome genetic map was created that covered all eleven linkage groups (LG). The LGs were linked to the physical map by sequence data of the TOGs compared to each chromosome sequence of common bean. The genetic map length in total was smaller than for previous maps reflecting the precision of allele calling and mapping with SNP technology as well as the use of gene-based markers. A total of 91.4\% of TOG markers had singleton hits with annotated Pv genes and all mapped outside of regions of resistance gene clusters. LD levels were found to be stronger within the Mesoamerican genepool and decay more rapidly within the Andean genepool. The recombination rate across the genome was 2.13 cM / Mb but R was found to be highly repressed around centromeres and frequent outside peri-centromeric regions. These results have important implications for association and genetic mapping or crop improvement in common bean.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossovers (COs) are essential for proper chromosome segregation and the reshuffling of alleles during meiosis. In WT plants, the number of COs is usually small, which limits the genetic variation that can be captured by plant breeding programs. Part of this limitation is imposed by proteins like FANCM, the inactivation of which results in a 3-fold increase in COs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether the same holds true in crops needed to be established. In this study, we identified EMS induced mutations in FANCM in two species of economic relevance within the genus Brassica. We showed that CO frequencies were increased in fancm mutants in both diploid and tetraploid Brassicas, Brassica rapa and Brassica napus respectively. In B. rapa, we observed a 3-fold increase in the number of COs, equal to the increase observed previously in Arabidopsis. In B. napus we observed a lesser but consistent increase (1.3-fold) in both euploid (AACC) and allohaploid (AC) plants. Complementation tests in A. thaliana suggest that the smaller increase in crossover frequency observed in B. napus reflects residual activity of the mutant C copy of FANCM. Altogether our results indicate that the anti-CO activity of FANCM is conserved across the Brassica, opening new avenues to make a wider range of genetic diversity accessible to crop improvement.},

  abstract = {A consensus genetic map of tetraploid cotton was constructed using six high-density maps and after the integration of a sequence-based marker redundancy check. Public cotton SSR libraries (17,343 markers) were curated for sequence redundancy using 90\% as a similarity cutoff. As a result, 20\% of the markers (3,410) could be considered as redundant with some other markers. The marker redundancy information had been a crucial part of the map integration process, in which the six most informative interspecific Gossypium hirsutum6G. barbadense genetic maps were used for assembling a high density consensus (HDC) map for tetraploid cotton. With redundant markers being removed, the HDC map could be constructed thanks to the sufficient number of collinear non-redundant markers in common between the component maps. The HDC map consists of 8,254 loci, originating from 6,669 markers, and spans 4,070 cM, with an average of 2 loci per cM. The HDC map presents a high rate of locus duplications, as 1,292 markers among the 6,669 were mapped in more than one locus. Two thirds of the duplications are bridging homoeologous AT and DT chromosomes constitutive of allopolyploid cotton genome, with an average of 64 duplications per AT/DT chromosome pair. Sequences of 4,744 mapped markers were used for a mutual blast alignment (BBMH) with the 13 major scaffolds of the recently released Gossypium raimondii genome indicating high level of homology between the diploid D genome and the tetraploid cotton genetic map, with only a few minor possible structural rearrangements. Overall, the HDC map will serve as a valuable resource for trait QTL comparative mapping, map-based cloning of important genes, and better understanding of the genome structure and evolution of tetraploid cotton.},

  abstract = {Background: Every chromosome requires at least one crossover to be faithfully segregated during meiosis. At least two levels of regulation govern crossover distribution: where the initiating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur and whether those DSBs are repaired as crossovers. Results: We mapped meiotic DSBs in budding yeast by identifying sites of DSB-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation. These analyses revealed substantial DSB activity in pericentrometric regions, in which crossover formation is largely absent. Our data suggest that centromeric suppression of recombination occurs at the level of break repair rather than DSB formation. Additionally, we found an enrichment of DSBs within a w100 kb region near the ends of all chromosomes. Introduction of new telomeres was sufficient for inducing large ectopic regions of increased DSB formation, thereby revealing a remarkable long-range effect of telomeres on DSB formation. The concentration of DSBs close to chromosome ends increases the relative DSB density on small chromosomes, providing an interference-independent mechanism that ensures that all chromosomes receive at least one crossover per homolog pair. Conclusions: Together, our results indicate that selective DSB repair accounts for crossover suppression near centromeres and suggest a simple telomere-guided mechanism that ensures sufficient DSB activity on all chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Polyploidization can have a significant ecological and evolutionary impact by providing substantially more genetic material that may result in novel phenotypes upon which selection may act. While the effects of polyploidization are broadly reviewed across the plant tree of life, the reproducibility of these effects within naturally occurring, independently formed polyploids is poorly characterized. The flowering plant genus               Tragopogon               (Asteraceae) offers a rare glimpse into the intricacies of repeated allopolyploid formation with both nascent (\&lt; 90 years old) and more ancient (mesopolyploids) formations. Neo- and mesopolyploids in               Tragopogon               have formed repeatedly and have extant diploid progenitors that facilitate the comparison of genome evolution after polyploidization across a broad span of evolutionary time. Here, we examine four independently formed lineages of the mesopolyploid               Tragopogon castellanus               for homoeolog expression changes and fractionation after polyploidization. We show that expression changes are remarkably similar among these independently formed polyploid populations with large convergence among expressed loci, moderate convergence among loci lost, and stochastic silencing. We further compare and contrast these results for               T. castellanus               with two nascent               Tragopogon               allopolyploids. While homoeolog expression bias was balanced in both nascent polyploids and               T. castellanus               , the degree of additive expression was significantly different, with the mesopolyploid populations demonstrating more non-additive expression. We suggest that gene dosage and expression noise minimization may play a prominent role in regulating gene expression patterns immediately after allopolyploidization as well as deeper into time, and these patterns are conserved across independent polyploid lineages.},

It enables the accumulation of favorable alleles while purging deleterious mutations. However, this mechanism is highly regulated with the formation of one to rarely more than three crossovers, which are not randomly distributed. In this study, we showed that it is possible to modify these controls in oilseed rape (Brassica napus, AACC, 2n = 4x = 38) and that it is linked to AAC allotriploidy and not to polyploidy per se. To that purpose, we compared the frequency and the distribution of crossovers along A chromosomes from hybrids carrying exactly the same A nucleotide sequence, but presenting three different ploidy levels: AA, AAC and AACC. Genetic maps established with 202 SNPs anchored on reference genomes revealed that the crossover rate is 3.6-fold higher in the AAC allotriploid hybrids compared to AA and AACC hybrids. Using a higher SNP density, we demonstrated that smaller and numerous introgressions of B. rapa were present in AAC hybrids compared to AACC allotetraploid hybrids, with 7.6 Mb vs. 16.9 Mb on average and 21 B. rapa regions per plant vs. nine regions, respectively. Therefore, this boost of recombination is highly efficient to reduce the size of QTL carried in cold regions of the oilseed rape genome, as exemplified here for a QTL conferring blackleg resistance.},

  abstract = {Detecting genetic signatures of selection is of great interest for many research issues. Common approaches to separate selective from neutral processes focus on the variance of FST across loci, as does the original Lewontin and Krakauer (LK) test. Modern developments aim to minimize the false positive rate and to increase the power, by accounting for complex demographic structures. Another stimulating goal is to develop straightforward parametric and computationally tractable tests to deal with massive SNP data sets. Here, we propose an extension of the original LK statistic (TLK), named TF{\textendash}LK , that uses a phylogenetic estimation of the population's kinship (F ) matrix, thus accounting for historical branching and heterogeneity of genetic drift. Using forward simulations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data under neutrality and selection, we confirm the relative robustness of the LK statistic (TLK) to complex demographic history but we show that TF{\textendash}LK is more powerful in most cases. This new statistic outperforms also a multinomial-Dirichlet-based model [estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)], when historical branching occurs. Overall, TF{\textendash}LK detects 15{\textendash}35\% more selected SNPs than TLK for low type I errors (P , 0.001). Also, simulations show that TLK and TF{\textendash}LK follow a chi-square distribution provided the ancestral allele frequencies are not too extreme, suggesting the possible use of the chi-square distribution for evaluating significance. The empirical distribution of TF{\textendash}LK can be derived using simulations conditioned on the estimated F matrix. We apply this new test to pig breeds SNP data and pinpoint outliers using TF{\textendash}LK, otherwise undetected using the less powerful TLK statistic. This new test represents one solution for compromise between advanced SNP genetic data acquisition and outlier analyses.},

To date, there are few robust estimates of this parameter for natural populations, and it is therefore unclear whether adaptive evolution can play a meaningful role in short-term population dynamics. We developed and applied quantitative genetic methods to long-term datasets from 19 wild bird and mammal populations and found that, while estimates vary between populations, additive genetic variance in relative fitness is often substantial and, on average, twice that of previous estimates. We show that these rates of contemporary adaptive evolution can affect population dynamics and hence that natural selection has the potential to partly mitigate effects of current environmental change.           ,              Rapid change                            Human impacts are leading to exceedingly rapid alteration of our world, from land conversion and habitat loss to climate change.

Bonnet               et al               . looked at additive genetic variance, which determines the contribution of selection to genetic change that increases fitness, in long-term data from 19 species and found it to be higher than expected{\textemdash}often substantially higher (see the Perspective by Walsh).

Understanding how climate change affects population performance is a critical scientific challenge. We combine a quantitative synthesis of field transplant experiments with a novel statistical approach based in evolutionary theory to quantify the effects of temperature and precipitation variability on population performance. We find that species' average performance is affected by both temperature and precipitation, but populations show signs of local adaptation to temperature only. Contemporary responses to temperature are strongly shaped by the local climates under which populations evolved, resulting in performance declines when temperatures deviate from historic conditions. Adaptation to other local environmental factors is strong, but temperature deviations as small as 2{$\smwhtcircle$}C erode the advantage that these non-climatic adaptations historically gave populations in their home sites.},

The effects of BGS reflect the interplay of the rates and fitness effects of deleterious mutations with recombination. A fundamental assumption of BGS models is that recombination rates are invariant over time. However, in some lineages recombination rates evolve rapidly, violating this central assumption. Here, we investigate how recombination rate evolution affects genetic variation under BGS. We show that recombination rate evolution modifies the effects of BGS in a manner similar to a localised change in the effective population size, potentially leading to an underestimation of the genome-wide effects of selection. Furthermore, we find evidence that recombination rate evolution in the ancestors of modern house mice may have impacted inferences of the genome-wide effects of selection in that species.},

Previous analysis of the recombination landscape in laboratory mice has revealed that the different subspecies have different suites of recombination hotspots. It is unknown, however, whether hotspots identified in laboratory strains reflect the hotspot diversity of natural populations or whether broad-scale variation in the rate of recombination is conserved between subspecies. In this study, we constructed fine-scale recombination rate maps for a natural population of the Eastern house mouse, Mus musculus castaneus. We performed simulations to assess the accuracy of recombination rate inference in the presence of phase errors, and we used a novel approach to quantify phase error. The spatial distribution of recombination events is strongly positively correlated between our castaneus map, and a map constructed using inbred lines derived predominantly from M. m. domesticus. Recombination hotspots in wild castaneus show little overlap, however, with the locations of double-strand breaks in wild-derived house mouse strains. Finally, we also find that genetic diversity in M. m. castaneus is positively correlated with the rate of recombination, consistent with pervasive natural selection operating in the genome. Our study suggests that recombination rate variation is conserved at broad scales between house mouse subspecies, but it is not strongly conserved at fine scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract           To what extent do substitutions in protein-coding versus gene-regulatory regions contribute to fitness change over time? Answering this question requires estimates of the extent of selection acting on beneficial mutations in the two classes of sites. New mutations that have advantageous or deleterious fitness effects can induce selective sweeps and background selection, respectively, causing variation in the level of neutral genetic diversity along the genome. In this study, we analyse the profiles of genetic variability around protein-coding and regulatory elements in the genomes of wild mice to estimate the parameters of positive selection. We find patterns of diversity consistent with the effects of selection at linked sites, which are similar across mouse taxa, despite differences in effective population size and demographic history. By fitting a model that combines the effects of selective sweeps and background selection, we estimate the strength of positive selection and the frequency of advantageous mutations. We find that strong positive selection is required to explain variation in genetic diversity across the murid genome. In particular, we estimate that beneficial mutations in protein-coding regions have stronger effects on fitness than do mutations in gene-regulatory regions, but that mutations in gene-regulatory regions are more common. Overall though, our parameter estimates suggest that the cumulative fitness changes brought about by beneficial mutations in protein-coding may be greater than those in gene-regulatory elements.},

  abstract = {Genome scans can potentially identify genetic loci involved in evolutionary processes such as local adaptation and gene flow. Here, we show that recombination rate variation across a neutrally evolving genome gives rise to mixed sampling distributions of mean FST (F{\^S}T), a common population genetic summary statistic. In particular, we show that in regions of low recombination the distribution of F{\^S}T estimates has more variance and a longer tail than in more highly recombining regions. Determining outliers from the genome-wide distribution without taking local recombination rate into consideration may therefore increase the frequency of false positives in low recombination regions and be overly conservative in more highly recombining ones. We perform genome scans on simulated and empirical Drosophila melanogaster data sets and, in both cases, find patterns consistent with this neutral model. Similar patterns are observed for other summary statistics used to capture variation in the coalescent process. Linked selection, particularly background selection, is often invoked to explain heterogeneity in F{\^S}T across the genome, but here we point out that even under neutrality, statistical artefacts can arise due to variation in recombination rate. Our results highlight a flaw in the design of genome-scan studies and suggest that without estimates of local recombination rate, interpreting the genomic landscape of any summary statistic that captures variation in the coalescent process will be very difficult.},

Recently, the multivariate neutral Moran model was proposed. However, it was shown insufficient to explain the distribution of alleles in great apes. Here, we propose a new model that includes allelic selection. Our theoretical results constitute the basis of a new Bayesian framework to estimate mutation rates and selection coefficients from population data. We apply the new framework to a great ape dataset, where we found patterns of allelic selection that match those of genome-wide GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). In particular, we show that great apes have patterns of allelic selection that vary in intensity{\textemdash}a feature that we correlated with great apes' distinct demographies. We also demonstrate that the AT/GC toggling effect decreases the probability of a substitution, promoting more polymorphisms in the base composition of great ape genomes. We further assess the impact of GC-bias in molecular analysis, and find that mutation rates and genetic distances are estimated under bias when gBGC is not properly accounted for. Our results contribute to the discussion on the tempo and mode of gBGC evolution, while stressing the need for gBGC-aware models in population genetics and phylogenetics.},

Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

  abstract = {Studies of meiotic recombination have revealed an evolutionary paradox. Molecular and genetic analysis has shown that crossing over initiates at specific sites called hotspots, by a recombinational-repair mechanism in which the initiating hotspot is replaced by a copy of its homolog. We have used computer simulations of large populations to show that this mechanism causes active hotspot alleles to be rapidly replaced by inactive alleles, which arise by rare mutation and increase by recombination-associated conversion. Additional simulations solidified the paradox by showing that the known benefits of recombination appear inadequate to maintain its mechanism. Neither the benefits of accurate segregation nor those of recombining flanking genes were sufficient to preserve active alleles in the face of conversion. A partial resolution to this paradox was obtained by introducing into the model an additional, nonmeiotic function for the sites that initiate recombination, consistent with the observed association of hotspots with functional sites in chromatin. Provided selection for this function was sufficiently strong, active hotspots were able to persist in spite of frequent conversion to inactive alleles. However, this explanation is unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, it is unlikely to apply to obligately sexual species, because observed crossover frequencies imply maintenance of many hotspots per genome, and the viability selection needed to preserve these would drive the species to extinction. Second, it fails to explain why such a genetically costly mechanism of recombination has been maintained over evolutionary time. Thus the paradox persists and is likely to be resolved only by significant changes to the commonly accepted mechanism of crossing over.},

Here, we review the current knowledge about the dynamics of transposable elements at recent evolutionary time scales, and discuss the mechanisms that condition their abundance and frequency. We first discuss non-adaptive mechanisms such as purifying selection and the variable rates of transposition and elimination, and then focus on positive and balancing selection, to finally conclude on the potential role of TEs in causing genomic incompatibilities and eventually speciation. We also suggest possible ways to better model TEs dynamics in a population genomics context by incorporating recent advances in TEs into the rich information provided by SNPs about the demography, selection, and intrinsic properties of genomes.},

This leads to relatively straightforward estimation of recombination frequencies using maximum likelihood, from which a genetic map can be derived. However, autopolyploids such as tetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) may exhibit additional features, such as double reduction, not normally encountered in diploid or allopolyploid species. In this study, we produced a high-density linkage map of tetraploid potato and used it to identify regions of double reduction in a biparental mapping population. The frequency of multivalents required to produce this degree of double reduction was determined through simulation. We also determined the effect that multivalents or preferential pairing between homologous chromosomes has on linkage mapping. Low levels of multivalents or preferential pairing do not adversely affect map construction when highly informative marker types and phases are used. We reveal the double-reduction landscape in tetraploid potato, clearly showing that this phenomenon increases with distance from the centromeres.},

SNP markers that can be identified through affordable sequencing processes, without the need for prior genome reduction or a reference genome to assemble sequencing data would allow the discovery and genetic mapping of thousands of molecular markers.

Results: A total of 419,024 SNPs were discovered using HiSeq whole genome sequencing of four pea lines, followed by direct identification of SNP markers without assembly using the discoSnp tool. Subsequent filtering led to the identification of 131,850 highly designable SNPs, polymorphic between at least two of the four pea lines. A subset of 64,754 SNPs was called and genotyped by short read sequencing on a subpopulation of 48 RILs from the cross `Baccara' x `PI180693'. This data was used to construct a WGGBS-derived pea genetic map comprising 64,263 markers. This map is collinear with previous pea consensus maps and therefore with the Medicago truncatula genome. Sequencing of four additional pea lines showed that 33 \% to 64 \% of the mapped SNPs, depending on the pairs of lines considered, are polymorphic and can therefore be useful in other crosses. The subsequent genotyping of a subset of 1000 SNPs, chosen for their mapping positions using a KASP{\texttrademark} assay, showed that almost all generated SNPs are highly designable and that most (95 \%) deliver highly qualitative genotyping results. Using rather low sequencing coverages in SNP discovery and in SNP inferring did not hinder the identification of hundreds of thousands of high quality SNPs. Conclusions: The development and optimization of appropriate tools in SNP discovery and genetic mapping have allowed us to make available a massive new genomic resource in pea. It will be useful for both fine mapping within chosen QTL confidence intervals and marker assisted breeding for important traits in pea improvement.},

  abstract = {The frequency of G and C nucleotides in genomes varies from species to species, and sometimes even between different genes in the same genome. The monocot grasses have a bimodal distribution of genic GC content absent in dicots. We categorized plant genes from 5 dicots and 4 monocot grasses by synteny to related species and determined that syntenic genes have significantly higher GC content than non-syntenic genes at their 5`-end in the third position within codons for all 9 species. Lower GC content is correlated with gene duplication, as lack of synteny to distantly related genomes is associated with past interspersed gene duplications. Two mutation types can account for biased GC content, mutation of methylated C to T and gene conversion from A to G. Gene conversion involves non-reciprocal exchanges between homologous alleles and is not detectable when the alleles are identical or heterozygous for presence-absence variation, both likely situations for genes duplicated to new loci. Gene duplication can cause production of siRNA which can induce targeted methylation, elevating mC{\textrightarrow}T mutations. Recently duplicated plant genes are more frequently methylated and less likely to undergo gene conversion, each of these factors synergistically creating a mutational environment favoring AT nucleotides. The syntenic genes with high GC content in the grasses compose a subset that have undergone few duplications, or for which duplicate copies were purged by selection. We propose a ``biased gene duplication / biased mutation'' (BDBM) model that may explain the origin and trajectory of the observed link between duplication and genic GC bias. The BDBM model is supported by empirical data based on joint analyses of 9 angiosperm species with their genes categorized by duplication status, GC content, methylation levels and functional classes.},

Mapped loci identify 61.5\% of the recombination events in this progeny set and reveal strong positive crossover interference acting across intervals of ’Ö50 cM. Significant variations in DNA marker density are related to possible centromeric regions and to probable chromosome structural rearrangements between Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum, but not to variation in levels of intraspecific allelic richness. While cDNA and genomic clones are similarly distributed across the genome, SSR-containing clones show different abundance patterns. Rapidly evolving hypomethylated DNA may contribute to intraspecific genomic differentiation. Nonrandom distribution patterns of multiple loci detected by 357 probes suggest ancient chromosomal duplication followed by extensive rearrangement and gene loss. Exemplifying the value of these data for comparative genomics, we support and extend prior findings regarding maize-sorghum synteny{\textemdash}in particular, 45\% of comparative loci fall outside the inferred colinear/syntenic regions, suggesting that many small rearrangements have occurred since maizesorghum divergence.

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} The USDA Cucumis melo inbred line, MR-1, harbors a wealth of alleles associated with resistance to several major diseases of melon, including powdery mildew, downy mildew, Alternaria leaf blight, and Fusarium wilt. MR-1 was crossed to an Israeli cultivar, Ananas Yok'neam, which is susceptible to all of these diseases, to generate a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 172 lines. In this study, the RIL population was genotyped to construct an ultra-dense genetic linkage map with 5663 binned SNPs anchored to the C. melo genome and exhibits the overall high quality of the assembly. The utility of the densely genotyped population was demonstrated through QTL mapping of a well-studied trait, resistance to Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis (Fom) race 1. A major QTL co-located with the previously validated resistance gene Fom-2. In addition, three minor QTLs and an epistatic interaction contributing to Fom race 1 resistance were identified. The MR-1 {\texttimes} AY RIL population provides a valuable resource for future QTL mapping studies and marker-assisted selection of disease resistance in melon.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Viticulture has to cope with climate change and to decrease pesticide inputs, while maintaining yield and wine quality. Breeding is a key lever to meet this challenge, and genomic prediction a promising tool to accelerate breeding programs. Multivariate methods are potentially more accurate than univariate ones. Moreover, some prediction methods also provide marker selection, thus allowing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detection and the identification of positional candidate genes. To study both genomic prediction and QTL detection for drought-related traits in grapevine, we applied several methods, interval mapping (IM) as well as univariate and multivariate penalized regression, in a bi-parental progeny. With a dense genetic map, we simulated two traits under four QTL configurations. The penalized regression method Elastic Net (EN) for genomic prediction, and controlling the marginal False Discovery Rate on EN selected markers to prioritize the QTLs. Indeed, penalized methods were more powerful than IM for QTL detection across various genetic architectures. Multivariate prediction did not perform better than its univariate counterpart, despite strong genetic correlation between traits. Using 14 traits measured in semi-controlled conditions under different watering conditions, penalized regression methods proved very efficient for intra-population prediction whatever the genetic architecture of the trait, with predictive abilities reaching 0.68. Compared to a previous study on the same traits, these methods applied on a denser map found new QTLs controlling traits linked to drought tolerance and provided relevant candidate genes. Overall, these findings provide a strong evidence base for implementing genomic prediction in grapevine breeding.},

Among them, we cover in depth the prominent problem of drifts (movements of the neurons with respect to the recording devices) and the current solutions to circumscribe it. In addition, we also review recent contributions making use of deep learning approaches for spike sorting, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we highlight efforts and advances in unifying, validating, and benchmarking spike sorting tools. Finally, we discuss the spike sorting field in terms of its open and unsolved challenges, specifically regarding scalability and reproducibility. We conclude by providing our personal view on the future of spike sorting, calling for a community-based development and validation of spike sorting algorithms and fully automated, cloud-based spike sorting solutions for the neuroscience community.},

Here, I revisit Lewontin's Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previouslypublished estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.},

However, observed levels of diversity across metazoans vary only two orders of magnitude, while census population sizes (             N                            c                          ) are expected to vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is a longstanding enigma in evolutionary genetics known as Lewontin's Paradox of Variation (1974). Since Lewontin's observation, it has been argued that selection constrains diversity across species, yet tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short of explaining the orders-of-magnitude reduction in diversity observed in nature. In this work, I revisit Lewontin's Paradox and assess whether current models of linked selection are likely to constrain diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine genetic data from 172 metazoan taxa with estimates of census sizes from geographic occurrence data and population densities estimated from body mass. Next, I fit the relationship between previously-published estimates of genomic diversity and these approximate census sizes to quantify Lewontin's Paradox. While previous across-taxa population genetic studies have avoided accounting for phylogenetic non-independence, I use phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the diversity census size relationship, estimate phylogenetic signal, and explore how diversity changes along the phylogeny. I consider whether the reduction in diversity predicted by models of recurrent hitch-hiking and background selection could explain the observed pattern of diversity across species. Since the impact of linked selection is mediated by recombination map length, I also investigate how map lengths vary with census sizes. I find species with large census sizes have shorter map lengths, leading these species to experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. Even after using high estimates of the strength of sweeps and background selection, I find linked selection likely cannot explain the shortfall between predicted and observed diversity levels across metazoan species. Furthermore, the predicted diversity under linked selection does not fit the observed diversity{\textendash}census-size relationship, implying that processes other than background selection and recurrent hitchhiking must be limiting diversity.},

  abstract = {Models of amino acid replacement are central to modern phylogenetic inference, particularly so when dealing with deep evolutionary relationships. Traditionally, a single, empirically derived matrix was utilized, so as to keep the degrees-offreedom of the inference low, and focused on topology. With the growing size of data sets, however, an amino acid-level general-time-reversible matrix has become increasingly feasible, treating amino acid exchangeabilities and frequencies as free parameters. Moreover, models based on mixtures of multiple matrices are increasingly utilized, in order to account for across-site heterogeneities in amino acid requirements of proteins. Such models exist as finite empirically-derived amino acid profile (or frequency) mixtures, free finite mixtures, as well as free Dirichlet process-based infinite mixtures. All of these approaches are typically combined with a gamma-distributed rates-across-sites model. In spite of the availability of these different aspects to modeling the amino acid replacement process, no study has systematically quantified their relative contributions to their predictive power of real data. Here, we use Bayesian cross-validation to establish a detailed comparison, while activating/deactivating each modeling aspect. For most data sets studied, we find that amino acid mixture models can outrank all single-matrix models, even when the latter include gamma-distributed rates and the former do not. We also find that free finite mixtures consistently outperform empirical finite mixtures. Finally, the Dirichlet process-based mixture model tends to outperform all other approaches.},

Domestication is also associated with important genomic changes, such as the loss of genetic diversity compared with adequately large wild populations, and modifications of gene expression patterns. Here, we explored theoretically the effect of a domestication-like scenario on the evolution of gene regulatory networks. We ran population genetics simulations in which individuals were featured by their genotype (an interaction matrix encoding a gene regulatory network) and their gene expressions, representing the phenotypic level. Our domestication scenario included a population bottleneck and a selection switch mimicking human-mediated directional and canalizing selection, i.e., change in the optimal gene expression level and selection toward more stable expression across environments. We showed that domestication profoundly alters genetic architectures. Based on four examples of plant domestication scenarios, our simulations predict (1) a drop in neutral allelic diversity; (2) a change in gene expression variance that depends upon the domestication scenario; (3) transient maladaptive plasticity; (4) a deep rewiring of the gene regulatory networks, with a trend toward gain of regulatory interactions; and (5) a global increase in the genetic correlations among gene expressions, with a loss of modularity in the resulting coexpression patterns and in the underlying networks. We provide empirically testable predictions on the differences of genetic architectures between wild and domesticated forms. The characterization of such systematic evolutionary changes in the genetic architecture of traits contributes to define a molecular domestication syndrome.},

Demographic history and linked selection have been proposed as main mechanisms, but their relative impact is not well understood. Here, we used the Aegilops/Triticum grass species, a group characterized by contrasted mating systems (from obligate out-crossing to high selfing) and marked recombination rate variation across the genome, to quantify the interaction between demography and linked selection on neutral and adaptive diversity. By analysing phenotypic and transcriptomic data, we found that selfing strongly affects genetic diversity and the efficacy of selection by amplifying the intensity of linked selection genome wide. Differently from expectations, this effect was gradual, with mixed mating species showing intermediate patterns. These results bear implications for the evolution of mating systems and more generally for our understanding of the fundamental drivers of genetic diversity.},

These findings at the genome-wide level support the occurrence of a global reduction of diversity during the domestication process, although several genes also showed patterns consistent with the action of selection. Nine hundred and forty-nine genes were significantly differentially expressed between wild and domesticated gene pools. Their functional annotation points to metabolic pathways most likely contributing to the sorghum domestication syndrome, such as photosynthesis and auxin metabolism. Coexpression network analyzes revealed 21 clusters of genes sharing similar expression patterns. Four clusters (totaling 2,449 genes) were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes between the wild and domesticated pools and two were also enriched in domestication and improvement genes previously identified in sorghum. These findings reinforce the evidence that the combined and intricated effects of the domestication and improvement processes do not only affect the behaviors of a few genes but led to a large rewiring of the transcriptome. Overall, these analyzes pave the way toward the identification of key domestication genes valuable for genetic resources characterization and breeding purposes.},

  abstract = {Selection has a deep impact on the distribution of genetic diversity and population differentiation along the genome (the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation), reducing diversity and elevating differentiation not only at the sites it targets, but also at linked neutral sites. Fuelled by the high-throughput sequencing revolution, these genomic footprints of selection have been extensively exploited over the past decade with the aim to identify genomic regions involved in adaptation and speciation. However, while this research has shown that the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation are usually highly heterogeneous, it has also led to the increasing realization that this heterogeneity may evolve under processes other than adaptation or speciation. In particular, instead of being an effect of selective sweeps or barriers to gene flow, accentuated differentiation can evolve by any process reducing genetic diversity locally within the genome (Charlesworth, 1998), including purifying selection at linked sites (background selection). In particular, in genomic regions where recombination is infrequent, accentuated differentiation can evolve as a by-product of diversity reductions unrelated to adaptation or speciation (Cruickshank \& Hahn, 2014; Nachman \& Payseur, 2012; Noor \& Bennett, 2009). In such genomic regions, linkage extends over physically larger genome stretches, and selection affects a particularly high number of linked neutral sites. Even though the effects of selection on linked neutral diversity (linked selection) within populations are well documented (Cutter \& Payseur, 2013), recent observations of diversity and differentiation landscapes that are highly correlated even among independent lineages suggest that the effects of long-term linked selection may have a deeper impact on the evolution of the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation than previously anticipated. The study on Saxicola stonechats by Van Doren et al. (2017) reported in the current issue of Molecular Ecology lines in with a rapidly expanding body of evidence in this direction. Correlations of genomic landscapes extending from within stonechats to comparisons with Ficedula flycatchers add to recent insights into the timescales across which the effects of linked selection persist. Absent and inverted correlations of genomic landscapes in comparisons involving an island taxon, on the other hand, provide important empirical clues about the role of demographic constraints in the evolution of the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation.},

  abstract = {One of the stronger empirical generalizations to emerge from the study of genetic systems is that achiasmate meiosis, which has evolved 25-30 times, is always restricted to the heterogametic sex in dioecious species. usually the male. Here we collate data on quantitative sex differences in chiasma frequency from 54 species (4 hermaphroditic flatworms, 18 dioecious insects and vertebrates and 32 hermaphroditic plants) to test whether similar trends hold. Though significant sex differences have been observed within many species, only the Liliaceae show a significant sexual dimorphism in chiasma frequency across species, with more crossing over in embryo mother cells than in pollen mother cells; chiasma frequencies are unrelated to sex and gamety in all other higher taxa studied. Further, the magnitude of sexual dimorphism. independent of sign, does not differ among the three main ecological groups (dioecious animals, plants, and hermaphroditic animals), contrary to what would be expected if it reflected sex-specific selection on recombination. These results indicate that the strong trends for achiasmate meiosis do not apply to quantitative sex differences in recombination, and contradict theories of sex-specific costs and benefits. An alternative hypothesis suggeststhat sex differences may be more-or-less neutral, selection determining only the mean rate of recombination. While male and female chiasma frequencies are more similar than would be expected under complete neutrality. a less absolute form of the hypothesis is more difficult to falsify. In female mice the sex bivalent has more chiasmata for its length than the autosomes, perhaps compensating for the absence of recombination in males. Finally, we observe that chiasma frequencies in males and females are positively correlated across species, validating the use of only one sex in comparative studies of recombination.},

After an enrichment procedure 40\% of colonies contained microsatellites in contrast with less than 1\% from a non-enriched library. The majority of microsatellite sequences were AC repeats. Co-dominant segregation of alleles in two full-sib crosses of A. mangium was demonstrated at 33 microsatellite loci. The markers were highly variable relative to restriction fragment lengths polymorphisms (RFLPs). In the two pedigrees 53\% of microsatellite loci were fully informative compared with 15\% of RFLPs. Based on alleles detected among four parental genotypes, the microsatellites consisting of dinucleotide repeats were more polymorphic than those with tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats. The microsatellite markers were not as transferable across species in the genus Acacia as RFLPs. Two thirds of the primers developed in A. mangium (subgenus Phyllodineae, section Juliflorae) amplified DNA from other species within the same section but failed to amplify in species from the subgenus Acacia. The availability of multiallelic, PCR-based, co-dominant microsatellite loci makes possible efficient studies of gene flow and breeding systems in A. mangium, a species with low allozyme variation.},

  abstract = {Simulations of relatives and identical by descent (IBD) segments are common in genetic studies, yet nearly all past efforts have utilized sex averaged genetic maps while ignoring crossover interference, thus omitting factors known to affect the breakpoints of IBD segments. We developed a method for simulating relatives called Ped-sim that can utilize either sex-specific or sex averaged genetic maps and also either a model of crossover interference or the traditional Poisson distribution for inter-crossover distances. To characterize the impact of previously ignored mechanisms, we simulated data for all four possible combinations of these factors using high resolution human genetic maps and interference parameters. Modeling crossover interference heavily influences the distribution of the proportion of their genome relatives share IBD, decreasing the standard deviation by 11.2\% on average for relatives ranging from full siblings to second cousins. By contrast, sex-specific maps increase the standard deviation of IBD proportion by an average of 3.37\%, and also impact the number of segments relatives share, most notably producing a bimodal distribution in segment numbers shared by half-siblings. We further compared IBD sharing rates between simulated and real relatives, finding that the combination of sex-specific maps and interference modeling most accurately captures real IBD sharing rates for the relationships we considered. Under this model, pairwise IBD sharing rates depend on the sexes of the individuals through which they are related. For example, when connected only through females (and their common fifth great-grandfather), 12.8\% of sixth cousins have some IBD sharing, while this rate drops to 9.05\% for male-descent sixth cousins. These analyses demonstrate that sex-specific maps and interference are key factors impacting IBD sharing and underscore the necessity of incorporating these effects into simulations.},

Brassica napus (2n = 38, AACC), the most important oil crop in the Brassica genus, is an allotetraploid that originated through natural doubling of chromosomes after the hybridization of its progenitor species, B. rapa (2n = 20, AA) and B. oleracea (2n = 18, CC). A better understanding of the evolutionary relationship between B. napus and B. rapa, B. oleracea, as well as Arabidopsis, which has a common ancestor with these three species, will provide valuable information about the generation and evolution of allopolyploidy. Based on a highdensity genetic map with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of B. napus with Arabidopsis and its progenitor species B. rapa and B. oleracea. Based on the collinear relationship of B. rapa and B. oleracea in the B. napus genetic map, the B. napus genome was found to consist of 70.1\% of the skeleton components of the chromosomes of B. rapa and B. oleracea, with 17.7\% of sequences derived from reciprocal translocation between homoeologous chromosomes between the A- and C-genome and 3.6\% of sequences derived from reciprocal translocation between non-homologous chromosomes at both intra- and inter-genomic levels. The current study thus provides insights into the formation and evolution of the allotetraploid B. napus genome, which will allow for more accurate transfer of genomic information from B. rapa, B. oleracea and Arabidopsis to B. napus.},

Reconstruction of ancestral Chenopodiaceae karyotype indicates substantial genome rearrangements in spinach after its divergence from ancestral Chenopodiaceae, coinciding with high repeat content in the spinach genome. Population genomic analyses provide insights into spinach genetic diversity and population differentiation. Genome-wide association studies of 20 agronomical traits identify numerous significantly associated regions and candidate genes for these traits. Domestication sweeps in the spinach genome are identified, some of which are associated with important traits (e.g., leaf phenotype, bolting and flowering), demonstrating the role of artificial selection in shaping spinach phenotypic evolution. This study provides not only insights into the spinach evolution and domestication but also valuable resources for facilitating spinach breeding.},

  abstract = {All organisms suffer double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their DNA as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation. DSBs can also form when replication forks encounter DNA lesions or repair intermediates. The processing and repair of DSBs can lead to mutations, loss of heterozygosity, and chromosome rearrangements that result in cell death or cancer. The most common pathway used to repair DSBs in metazoans (non-homologous DNA end joining) is more commonly mutagenic than the alternative pathway (homologous recombination mediated repair). Thus, factors that influence the choice of pathways used DSB repair can affect an individual's mutation burden and risk of cancer. This review describes radiological, chemical, and biological mechanisms that generate DSBs, and discusses the impact of such variables as DSB etiology, cell type, cell cycle, and chromatin structure on the yield, distribution, and processing of DSBs. The final section focuses on nucleosome-specific mechanisms that influence DSB production, and the possible relationship between higher order chromosome coiling and chromosome shattering (chromothripsis).

  abstract = {Meiotic crossovers (COs) have intriguing patterning properties, including CO interference, the tendency of COs to be well-spaced along chromosomes, and heterochiasmy, the marked difference in male and female CO rates. During meiosis, transverse filaments transiently associate the axes of homologous chromosomes, a process called synapsis that is essential for CO formation in many eukaryotes. Here, we describe the spatial organization of the transverse filaments in               Arabidopsis               (ZYP1) and show it to be evolutionary conserved. We show that in the absence of ZYP1 (               zyp1a               zyp1b               null mutants), chromosomes associate in pairs but do not synapse. Unexpectedly, in absence of ZYP1, CO formation is not prevented but increased. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis of recombination revealed that CO interference is abolished, with the frequent observation of close COs. In addition, heterochiasmy was erased, with identical CO rates in males and females. This shows that the tripartite synaptonemal complex is dispensable for CO formation and has a key role in regulating their number and distribution, imposing CO interference and heterochiasmy.},

Compositional DNA fractions corresponding to different isochore families were used to investigate, by hybridization with appropriate probes, the gene distribution in vertebrate genomes. Here we report such a study on the genome of a plant, maize. The gene distribution that we found is most striking, in that almost all genes are present in isochores covering an extremely narrow (1-2\%) GC range and only representing 10-20\% of the genome. This gene distribution, which seems to characterize other Gramineae as well, is remarkably different from the gene distribution previously found in vertebrate genomes.},

One class, the GC-rich class, contained genes with no, or few, short introns. In contrast, the GC-poor class contained genes with numerous, long introns. The similarity of the properties of each class, as present in the genomes of maize and Arabidopsis, is particularly remarkable in view of the fact that these plants exhibit large differences in genome size, average intron size, and DNA base composition. The functional relevance of the two classes of genes is stressed by (1) the conservation in homologous genes from maize and Arabidopsis not only of the number of introns and of their positions, but also of the relative size of concatenated introns; and (2) the existence of two similar classes of genes in vertebrates; interestingly, the differences in intron sizes and numbers in genes from the GC-poor and GC-rich classes are much more striking in plants than in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {This study reports the construction of high density linkage maps of Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) using single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs), obtained with a GBS strategy. The mapping population (An x Au) was obtained by crossing cv. ``Angeleno'' (An) as maternal line and cv. ``Aurora'' (Au) as the pollen donor. A total of 49,826 SNPs were identified using the peach genome V2.1 as a reference. Then a stringent filtering was carried out, which revealed 1,441 high quality SNPs in 137 An x Au offspring, which were mapped in eight linkage groups. Finally, the consensus map was built using 732 SNPs which spanned 617 cM with an average of 0.96 cM between adjacent markers. The majority of the SNPs were distributed in the intragenic region in all the linkage groups. Considering all linkage groups together, 85.6\% of the SNPs were located in intragenic regions and only 14.4\% were located in intergenic regions. The genetic linkage analysis was able to co-localize two to three SNPs over 37 putative orthologous genes in eight linkage groups in the Japanese plum map. These results indicate a high level of synteny and collinearity between Japanese plum and peach genomes.},

We have developed a software package, called TMAP, which uses this model to find maximum-likelihood maps for phase-known pedigrees.

Remarkably, we found that crossovers were abolished at core centromeric units but not at their vicinity indicating the absence of a centromere effect across repeat-based holocentromeres. We further show that telomere-led pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes appear to be the primary force determining the observed U-shaped recombination landscape. While centromere and (epi)genetic properties only affect crossover positioning locally.

  abstract = {Background: Solanum pimpinellifolium has high breeding potential for fruit quality traits and has been used as a donor in tomato breeding programs. Unlocking the genetic potential of S. pimpinellifolium requires high-throughput polymorphism identification protocols for QTL mapping and introgression of favourable alleles into cultivated tomato by both positive and background selection. Results: In this study we identified SNP loci using a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach in an IBL mapping population derived from the cross between a high yielding fresh market tomato and S. pimpinellifolium (LA1589) as the recurrent and donor parents, respectively. A total of 120,983,088 reads were generated by the Illumina HiSeq next-generation sequencing platform. From these reads 448,539 sequence tags were generated. A majority of the sequence tags (84.4\%) were uniquely aligned to the tomato genome. A total of 3.125 unique SNP loci were identified as a result of tag alignment to the genome assembly and were used in QTL analysis of 11 fruit quality traits. As a result, 37 QTLs were identified. S. pimpinellifolium contributed favourable alleles for 16 QTLs (43.2\%), thus confirming the high breeding potential of this wild species. Conclusions: The present work introduced a set of SNPs at sufficiently high density for QTL mapping in populations derived from S. pimpinellifolium (LA1589). Moreover, this study demonstrated the high efficiency of the GBS approach for SNP identification, genotyping and QTL mapping in an interspecific tomato population.},

  abstract = {Hexaploid oat (Avena sativa L., 2n = 6x = 42) is a member of the Poaceae family and has a large genome ({\textasciitilde}12.5 Gb) containing 21 chromosome pairs from three ancestral genomes. Physical rearrangements among parental genomes have hindered the development of linkage maps in this species. The objective of this work was to develop a single high-density consensus linkage map that is representative of the majority of commonly grown oat varieties. Data from a cDNA-derived single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) were collected from the progeny of 12 biparental recombinant inbred line populations derived from 19 parents representing oat germplasm cultivated primarily in North America. Linkage groups from all mapping populations were compared to identify 21 clusters of conserved collinearity. Linkage groups within each cluster were then merged into 21 consensus chromosomes, generating a framework consensus map of 7202 markers spanning 2843 cM. An additional 9678 markers were placed on this map with a lower degree of certainty. Assignment to physical chromosomes with high confidence was made for nine chromosomes. Comparison of homeologous regions among oat chromosomes and matches to orthologous regions of rice (Oryza sativa L.) reveal that the hexaploid oat genome has been highly rearranged relative to its ancestral diploid genomes as a result of frequent translocations among chromosomes. Heterogeneous chromosome rearrangements among populations were also evident, probably accounting for the failure of some linkage groups to match the consensus. This work contributes to a further understanding of the organization and evolution of hexaploid grass genomes.},

In a first step, male and female maps were established independently with test-cross markers segregating 1:1 (presence:absence of the amplified fragment in the full-sib progeny). In a second step, both maps were merged using intercross markers segregating 3:1 in the progeny. A combination of MAPMAKER and JOINMAP softwares was used for the mapping process. A consensus map was obtained and is available at URL http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/genetics/pinus/Map3/index.html. It covers 1441 cM and comprises a total of 620 AFLP markers on 12 linkage groups. The physical size of the maritime pine genome (51.5 pg/2C) was measured by flow cytometry, providing a physical/genetic size ratio of 13.78 Mb/cM. This map will be used to dissect the genetic architecture of economically (growth, wood quality) and ecologically (water-use efficiency) important traits into mendelian inherited components (QTLs: Quantitative Trait Loci). It will also provide a framework to localize more informative markers (ESTs: Expressed Sequence Tags) to be used as candidate genes in QTL detection experiments. The location of orthologous markers (ESTs and SSRs: Simple Sequence Repeats) will also allow the study of the genome structure of closely related conifer species using a comparative genome mapping approach.},

We propose a maximum likelihood method for estimating this quantity from counts of recombinants and nonrecombinants between marker locus pairs studied from a backcross linkage experiment, assuming no interference and equal chromosome lengths. This method allows the calculation of the standard deviation of the estimate and a confidence interval containing the estimate. Computer simulations have been performed to evaluate and compare the accuracoyf the maximum likelihood method anda previously suggested method-of-moments estimator. Specifically, we have investigated the effects of the number of meioses, the number of marker loci, and variation in the genetic lengths of individual chromosomes tohne estimate.The effect of missing data, obtained when the resultsof two separate linkage studiews ith a fraction of marker loci in common are pooled, is alsoinvestigated. The maximumlikelihoodestimator,incontrasttothemethod-of-moments estimator, is relatively insensitive to violationof theassumptionsmadeduringanalysisand is the method of choice.

  abstract = {The genomic origins of rape oilseed                            Many domesticated plants arose through the meeting of multiple genomes through hybridization and genome doubling, known as polyploidy. Chalhoub               et al.               sequenced the polyploid genome of               Brassica napus               , which originated from a recent combination of two distinct genomes approximately 7500 years ago and gave rise to the crops of rape oilseed (canola), kale, and rutabaga.               B. napus               has undergone multiple events affecting differently sized genetic regions where a gene from one progenitor species has been converted to the copy from a second progenitor species. Some of these gene conversion events appear to have been selected by humans as part of the process of domestication and crop improvement.                                         Science               , this issue p.               950                        ,              The polyploid genome of oilseed rape exhibits evolution through homologous gene conversion.           ,                             Oilseed rape (               Brassica napus               L.) was formed {\textasciitilde}7500 years ago by hybridization between               B. rapa               and               B. oleracea               , followed by chromosome doubling, a process known as allopolyploidy. Together with more ancient polyploidizations, this conferred an aggregate 72{\texttimes} genome multiplication since the origin of angiosperms and high gene content. We examined the               B. napus               genome and the consequences of its recent duplication. The constituent A               n               and C               n               subgenomes are engaged in subtle structural, functional, and epigenetic cross-talk, with abundant homeologous exchanges. Incipient gene loss and expression divergence have begun. Selection in               B. napus               oilseed types has accelerated the loss of glucosinolate genes, while preserving expansion of oil biosynthesis genes. These processes provide insights into allopolyploid evolution and its relationship with crop domestication and improvement.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Control of gene expression has been found to be predominantly determined at the level of protein translation. However, to date, reduced expression from duplicated genes in eukaryotes for dosage maintenance has only been linked to transcriptional control involving epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we hypothesize that dosage maintenance following gene duplication also involves regulation at the protein level. To test this hypothesis, we compared transcriptome and proteome data of yeast models, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and worm models, Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae, to investigate lineage-specifically duplicated genes. Duplicated genes in both eukaryotic models exhibited a reduced protein-to-mRNA abundance ratio. Moreover, dosage sensitive genes, represented by genes encoding protein complex subunits, reduced their protein-to-mRNA abundance ratios more significantly than the other genes after duplication events. An analysis of ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) data further showed that reduced translational efficiency was more prominent for dosage sensitive genes than for the other genes. Meanwhile, no difference in protein degradation rate was associated with duplication events. Translationally repressed duplicated genes were also more likely to be inhibited at the level of transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that translation-mediated dosage control is partially contributed by natural selection and it enhances transcriptional control in maintaining gene dosage after gene duplication events during eukaryotic genome evolution},

Here, we examine recombination landscapes across the 18 chromosomes of cassava (             Manihot esculenta             Crantz) with respect to male and female meioses and known introgressions from the wild relative             Manihot glaziovii             . We used SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM to infer crossovers from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data and a validated multi-generational pedigree from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) cassava breeding germplasm consisting of 7,020 informative meioses. We then constructed new genetic maps and compared them to an existing map previously constructed by the International Cassava Genetic Map Consortium (ICGMC). We observed higher recombination rates in females compared to males, and lower recombination rates in             M. glaziovii             introgression segments on chromosomes 1 and 4, with suppressed recombination along the entire length of the chromosome in the case of the chromosome 4 introgression. Finally, we discuss hypothesized mechanisms underlying our observations of heterochiasmy and crossover suppression and discuss the broader implications for plant breeding.},

Approximately 69\% of all orchid species are epiphytes, which provide diverse microhabitats for many small animals and fungi in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Moreover, many orchids are of economic importance as food flavourings or ornamental plants. Phalaenopsis aphrodite, an epiphytic orchid, is a major breeding parent of many commercial orchid hybrids. We provide a high-quality chromosomescale assembly of the P. aphrodite genome. The total length of all scaffolds is 1025.1 Mb, with N50 scaffold size of 19.7 Mb. A total of 28 902 protein-coding genes were identified. We constructed an orchid genetic linkage map, and then anchored and ordered the genomic scaffolds along the linkage groups. We also established a high-resolution pachytene karyotype of P. aphrodite and completed the assignment of linkage groups to the 19 chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization. We identified an expansion in the epiphytic orchid lineage of FRS5-like subclade associated with adaptations to the life in the canopy. Phylogenetic analysis further provides new insights into the orchid lineage-specific duplications of MADS-box genes, which might have contributed to the variation in labellum and pollinium morphology and its accessory structure. To our knowledge, this is the first orchid genome to be integrated with a SNP-based genetic linkage map and validated by physical mapping. The genome and genetic map not only offer unprecedented resources for increasing breeding efficiency in horticultural orchids but also provide an important foundation for future studies in adaptation genomics of epiphytes.},

  abstract = {The process of evolution at a given site in the genome can be influenced by the action of selection at other sites, especially when these are closely linked to it. Such selection reduces the effective population size experienced by the site in question (the Hill{\textendash}Robertson effect), reducing the level of variability and the efficacy of selection. In particular, deleterious variants are continually being produced by mutation and then eliminated by selection at sites throughout the genome. The resulting reduction in variability at linked neutral or nearly neutral sites can be predicted from the theory of background selection, which assumes that deleterious mutations have such large effects that their behavior in the population is effectively deterministic. More weakly selected mutations can accumulate by Muller's ratchet after a shutdown of recombination, as in an evolving Y chromosome. Many functionally significant sites are probably so weakly selected that Hill{\textendash}Robertson interference undermines the effective strength of selection upon them, when recombination is rare or absent. This leads to large departures from deterministic equilibrium and smaller effects on linked neutral sites than under background selection or Muller's ratchet. Evidence is discussed that is consistent with the action of these processes in shaping genome-wide patterns of variation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Levels of neutral genetic diversity in populations subdivided into   two demes were studied by multi-locus stochastic simulations. The model   includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the  genome, causing `background selection', as well as a single   locus at which a polymorphism is  maintained, either by frequency-dependent selection or by local  selective differences. These  balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral   loci, so that sequence  diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study  how  equilibrium neutral  diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision,  the  presence or absence of  background selection, and the level of inbreeding of the population. The   simulation results are  compared with approximate analytical formulae, assuming the infinite  sites neutral model. We  discuss how balancing selection can be distinguished from local selection,   by determining whether  peaks of diversity in the region of the polymorphic locus are seen within   or between demes. The  width of such diversity peaks is shown to depend on the total species  population size, rather than  local deme sizes. We show that, with population subdivision, local  selection enhances between-deme diversity even at neutral sites distant  from  the polymorphic locus, producing higher               F                                ST                              values than with no selection; very high values can be generated at sites   close to a selected locus.  Background selection also increases               F                                ST                              ,  mainly because of decreased diversity within populations,  which implies that its effects may be distinguishable from those of local   selection. Both effects are  stronger in selfing than outcrossing populations. Linkage disequilibrium   between neutral sites is  generated by both balancing and local selection, especially in selfing   populations, because of  linkage disequilibrium between the neutral sites and the selectively  maintained alleles. We discuss  how these theoretical results can be related to data on genetic diversity   within and between local populations of a species.},

  abstract = {Abstract           The effects of selection on variability at linked sites have an important influence on levels and patterns of within-population variation across the genome. Most theoretical models of these effects have assumed that selection is sufficiently strong that allele frequency changes at the loci concerned are largely deterministic. These models have led to the conclusion that directional selection for new selectively favorable mutations, or against recurrent deleterious mutations, reduces nucleotide site diversity at linked neutral sites. Recent work has shown, however, that fixations of weakly selected mutations, accompanied by significant stochastic changes in allele frequencies, can sometimes cause higher diversity at linked sites when compared with the effects of fixations of neutral mutations. The present paper extends this work by deriving approximate expressions for the mean times to loss and fixation of mutations subject to selection, and analysing the conditions under which selection increases rather than reduces these times. Simulations are used to examine the relations diversity at a neutral site and the fixation and loss times of mutations at a linked site subject to selection. It is shown that the long-term level of neutral diversity can be increased over the equilibrium expectation in the absence of selection by recurrent fixations and losses of linked, weakly selected dominant or partially dominant favorable mutations, and by linked recessive or partially recessive deleterious mutations. The results are used to examine the conditions under which associative overdominance, as opposed to background selection, is likely to operate.},

  abstract = {We suggest hypotheses to account for two major features of chromosomal organization in higher eukaryotes. T h e first of these is the general restriction of crossing over in the neighborhood of centromeres and telomeres. We propose that this is a consequence of selection for reduced rates of unequal exchange between repeated DNA sequences for which the copy number is subject to stabilizing selection: microtubule binding sites, in the case of centromeres, and the short repeated sequences needed for terminal replication of a linear DNA molecule, in the case of telomeres. An association between proximal crossing over and nondisjunction would also favor the restriction of crossing over near the centromere. T h e second feature is the association between highly repeated DNA sequences of no obvious functional significance and regions of restricted crossing over. We show that highly repeated sequences are likely to persist longest (over evolutionary time) when crossing over is infrequent. This is because unequal exchange among repeated sequences generates single copy sequences, and a population that becomes fixed for a single copy sequence by drift remains in this state indefinitely (in the absence of gene amplification processes). Increased rates of exchange thus speed up the process of stochastic loss of repeated sequences.},

The logarithm of the fitness of an individual with               n               mutations is assumed to be a quadratic, decreasing function of               n               . The equilibrium properties of infinitely large asexual populations, random-mating populations lacking genetic recombination, and random-mating populations with arbitrary recombination frequencies are investigated. With `synergistic' epistasis on the scale of log fitness, such that log fitness declines more steeply as               n               increases, it is shown that equilibrium mean fitness is least for asexual populations. In sexual populations, mean fitness increases with the number of chromosomes and with the map length per chromosome. With `diminishing returns' epistasis, such that log fitness declines less steeply as               n               increases, mean fitness behaves in the opposite way. Selection on asexual variants and genes affecting the rate of genetic recombination in random-mating populations was also studied. With synergistic epistasis, zero recombination always appears to be disfavoured, but free recombination is disfavoured when the mutation rate per genome is sufficiently small, leading to evolutionary stability of maps of intermediate length. With synergistic epistasis, an asexual mutant is unlikely to invade a sexual population if the mutation rate per diploid genome greatly exceeds unity. Recombination is selectively disadvantageous when there is diminishing returns epistasis. These results are compared with the results of previous theoretical studies of this problem, and with experimental data.},

This has been interpreted as evidence either for a direct effect of recombination on fitness, or for the maintenance of linkage disequilibria by epistatic selection. Here we show that such a recombination load is to be expected even if selection favours increased genetic recombination. This is because of the fact that, although a modifier may suffer an immediate loss of fitness if it increases recombination, it eventually becomes associated with a higher additive genetic variance in fitness, which allows a faster response to directionselection. This argument applies to mutation-selection balance with synergistic epistasis, directional selection on quantitative traits, and ectopic exchange among transposable elements. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the selection against recombination due to trie immediate load is outweighed by the increased additive variance in fitness produced by recombination.},

Although two draft genomes of tea plant (               Camellia sinensis               ) have been published recently, the lack of chromosome-scale assembly hampers the understanding of the fundamental genomic architecture of tea plant and potential improvement. Here, we performed a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technique (Hi-C) to obtain a chromosome-scale assembly based on the draft genome of               C. sinensis               var.               sinensis               and successfully ordered 2984.7\,Mb (94.7\%) scaffolds into 15 chromosomes. The scaffold N50 of the improved genome was 218.1\,Mb, {\textasciitilde}157-fold higher than that of the draft genome. Collinearity comparison of genome sequences and two genetic maps validated the high contiguity and accuracy of the chromosome-scale assembly. We clarified that only one               Camellia               recent tetraploidization event (CRT, 58.9{\textendash}61.7 million years ago (Mya)) occurred after the core-eudicot common hexaploidization event (146.6{\textendash}152.7 Mya). Meanwhile, 9243 genes (28.6\%) occurred in tandem duplication, and most of these expanded after the CRT event. These gene duplicates increased functionally divergent genes that play important roles in tea-specific biosynthesis or stress response. Sixty-four catechin- and caffeine-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were anchored to chromosome assembly. Of these, two catechin-related QTL hotspots were derived from the CRT event, which illustrated that polyploidy has played a dramatic role in the diversification of tea germplasms. The availability of a chromosome-scale genome of tea plant holds great promise for the understanding of genome evolution and the discovery of novel genes contributing to agronomically beneficial traits in future breeding programs.},

Currently, it is still unclear how much of this local co-expression is caused by direct transcriptional interactions, and how much is due to shared chromatin environments.                                         Results                                We analysed neighbouring genes in                 Arabidopsis thaliana                 . At large intergenic distances ({$>$}400 bp), divergently and convergently transcribed gene pairs show very similar levels of co-expression, mediated most likely by shared chromatin environments. At gene distances below 400 bp, co-expression is strongly enhanced only for divergently transcribed gene pairs, indicating bi-directional transcription from a single promoter. Conversely, co-expression is suppressed for short convergently or uni-directionally transcribed pairs. This suppression points to transcriptional interference concentrated at the 3' end, e.g., in the context of transcription termination.                                                        Conclusions               Classifying linked gene pairs by their orientation, we are able to partially tease apart the different levels of regional expression modulation. (i) Regional chromatin characteristics modulate the accessibility for regulation and transcription, regardless of gene orientation; the strength of this chromatin effect can be assessed from divergently or convergently transcribed distant neighbours. (ii) Shared promoter regions up to 400 bp in length enhance the co-expression of close bi-directional neighbours. (iii) Transcriptional interference of close neighbours is concentrated at the 3' ends of genes, and reduces co-expression on average by 40\%.},

  abstract = {Background: QTLs controlling individual sugars and acids (fructose, glucose, malic acid and tartaric acid) in grape berries have not yet been identified. The present study aimed to construct a high-density, high-quality genetic map of a winemaking grape cross with a complex parentage (V. vinifera {\texttimes} V. amurensis) {\texttimes} ((V. labrusca {\texttimes} V. riparia) {\texttimes} V. vinifera), using next-generation restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, and then to identify loci related to phenotypic variability over three years. Results: In total, 1 826 SNP-based markers were developed. Of these, 621 markers were assembled into 19 linkage groups (LGs) for the maternal map, 696 for the paternal map, and 1 254 for the integrated map. Markers showed good linear agreement on most chromosomes between our genetic maps and the previously published V. vinifera reference sequence. However marker order was different in some chromosome regions, indicating both conservation and variation within the genome. Despite the identification of a range of QTLs controlling the traits of interest, these QTLs explained a relatively small percentage of the observed phenotypic variance. Although they exhibited a large degree of instability from year to year, QTLs were identified for all traits but tartaric acid and titratable acidity in the three years of the study; however only the QTLs for malic acid and {$\beta$} ratio (tartaric acid-to-malic acid ratio) were stable in two years. QTLs related to sugars were located within ten LGs (01, 02, 03, 04, 07, 09, 11, 14, 17, 18), and those related to acids within three LGs (06, 13, 18). Overlapping QTLs in LG14 were observed for fructose, glucose and total sugar. Malic acid, total acid and {$\beta$} ratio each had several QTLs in LG18, and malic acid also had a QTL in LG06. A set of 10 genes underlying these QTLs may be involved in determining the malic acid content of berries. Conclusion: The genetic map constructed in this study is potentially a high-density, high-quality map, which could be used for QTL detection, genome comparison, and sequence assembly. It may also serve to broaden our understanding of the grape genome.},

Fifty-four F2 plants derived from varieties AU9 and SunUp were used for linkage mapping. A total of 707 markers, including 706 microsatellite loci and the morphological marker fruit flesh color, were mapped into nine major and three minor linkage groups. The resulting map spanned 1069.9 cM with an average distance of 1.5 cM between adjacent markers. This sequence-based microsatellite map resolved the very large linkage group 2 (LG 2) of the previous high-density map using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. The nine major LGs of our map represent papaya's haploid nine chromosomes with LG 1 of the sex chromosome being the largest. This map validates the suppression of recombination at the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) mapped on LG 1 and at potential centromeric regions of other LGs. Segregation distortion was detected in a large region on LG 1 surrounding the MSY region due to the abortion of the YY genotype and in a region of LG6 due to an unknown cause. This high-density sequence-tagged genetic map is being used to integrate genetic and physical maps and to assign genome sequence scaffolds to papaya chromosomes.

  abstract = {Background: Brassica species include both vegetable and oilseed crops, which are very important to the daily life of common human beings. Meanwhile, the Brassica species represent an excellent system for studying numerous aspects of plant biology, specifically for the analysis of genome evolution following polyploidy, so it is also very important for scientific research. Now, the genome of Brassica rapa has already been assembled, it is the time to do deep mining of the genome data. Description: BRAD, the Brassica database, is a web-based resource focusing on genome scale genetic and genomic data for important Brassica crops. BRAD was built based on the first whole genome sequence and on further data analysis of the Brassica A genome species, Brassica rapa (Chiifu-401-42). It provides datasets, such as the complete genome sequence of B. rapa, which was de novo assembled from Illumina GA II short reads and from BAC clone sequences, predicted genes and associated annotations, non coding RNAs, transposable elements (TE), B. rapa genes' orthologous to those in A. thaliana, as well as genetic markers and linkage maps. BRAD offers useful searching and data mining tools, including search across annotation datasets, search for syntenic or nonsyntenic orthologs, and to search the flanking regions of a certain target, as well as the tools of BLAST and Gbrowse. BRAD allows users to enter almost any kind of information, such as a B. rapa or A. thaliana gene ID, physical position or genetic marker. Conclusion: BRAD, a new database which focuses on the genetics and genomics of the Brassica plants has been developed, it aims at helping scientists and breeders to fully and efficiently use the information of genome data of Brassica plants. BRAD will be continuously updated and can be accessed through http://brassicadb.org.},

  abstract = {Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is one of the most economically important crops for fibre production. Genetic maps have been developed in almost all the agricultural crops. However, genetic information for kenaf, especially, at the molecular level is limited. To better understand the genetic basis of kenaf for the improvement of production and to lay the foundation for molecular breeding efforts, a primary genetic linkage map was constructed using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP), inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Cultivar {\^O}Alian kenaf{\~O} and {\^O}Fuhong 992{\~O} were used as parents to construct an F2 population consisting of 180 plants. We selected 494 SRAP, 60 ISSR, 120 RAPD and 300 two-primer RAPD mixture primers that amplified 396 polymorphic loci in total. At a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score threshold of 5.0 and at a maximum map distance of 25 cM, these 396 loci were used to construct the genetic linkage map with MAPMAKER/EXP 3.0, a total of 307 loci were grouped into 26 linkage groups that spanned a total map length of around 4924.8 cM with a mean density of 16.04 cM per locus. These markers were distributed randomly in all linkage groups without any clustering. The construction of the kenaf genetic linkage map will be useful for further genetic studies including mapping both qualitative and quantitative traits, marker-assisted selection program, and comparative genomics analysis.},

Identification of molecular markers and construction of genetic linkage maps in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), a classical model plant and important economic crop, have remained limited. In the present study we identified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and constructed a high-density SNP genetic map for tobacco using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. In 1216.30 Gb of clean sequence obtained using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform, 99,647,735 SNPs were identified that differed between 203 sequenced plant genomes and the tobacco reference genome. Finally, 13,273 SNP markers were mapped on 24 high-density tobacco genetic linkage groups. The entire linkage map spanned 3421.80 cM, with a mean distance of 0.26 cM between adjacent markers. Compared with genetic linkage maps published previously, this version represents a considerable improvement in the number and density of markers. Seven QTL for resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in tobacco were mapped to groups 5 and 8. This high-density genetic map is a promising tool for elucidation of the genetic bases of QTL and for molecular breeding in tobacco.},

Crossovers establish chiasmata, which are physical connections between homologous chromosomes that provide the tension necessary to align chromosomes on the meiotic spindle. Understanding the mechanisms underlying crossover control has been hampered by the difficulty in determining crossover distributions. Here, we present a microarray-based method to analyze multiple aspects of crossover control simultaneously and rapidly, at high resolution, genomewide, and on a cell-by-cell basis. Using this approach, we show that loss of interference in zip2 and zip4/spo22 mutants is accompanied by a reduction in crossover homeostasis, thus connecting these two levels of crossover control. We also provide evidence to suggest that repression of crossing over at telomeres and centromeres arises from different mechanisms. Lastly, we uncover a surprising role for the synaptonemal complex component Zip1 in repressing crossing over at the centromere.},

Intensified outbreaks of late blight have been observed globally from the 1980s, and are associated with migration of new and more aggressive populations of P. infestans in the field. The objective of this study was to reassess late blight resistance in the wild tomato accession L3708 (Solanum pimpinellifolium L.) against pathogens of different aggressiveness. An F2:3 genetic mapping population was developed using L3708 as the paternal parent. Two isolates of P. infestans, Pi39A and Pi733, were used for inoculation. Pi733 is a highly aggressive genotype that defeats three known late blight resistance genes, Ph-1, Ph-2, and Ph-5t in tomato. In contrast, Pi39A is a less aggressive genotype that defeats only Ph-1. Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) technology was used to massively sequence 90 bp nucleotides adjacent to both sides of PstI restriction enzyme cutting sites in the genome for all individuals in the genetic mapping population. The RAD-seq data were used to construct a genetic linkage map containing 440 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a new disease-resistant QTL specific to Pi733 on chromosome 2. The Ph-3 gene located on chromosome 9 could be detected whichever isolates were used. This study demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of RAD-Seq technology for conducting a QTL mapping experiment using an F2:3 mapping population, which allowed the identification of a new late blight resistant QTL in tomato.},

Despite the numerous advances in genome reports or sequencing technologies, no review covers all the released angiosperm genomes and the genome databases for data sharing. Based on the rapid advances and innovations in the database reconstruction in the last few years, here we provide a comprehensive review for three major types of angiosperm genome databases, including databases for a single species, for a specific angiosperm clade, and for multiple angiosperm species. The scope, tools, and data of each type of databases and their features are concisely discussed. The genome databases for a single species or a clade of species are especially popular for specific group of researchers, while a timely-updated comprehensive database is more powerful for address of major scientific mysteries at the genome scale. Considering the low coverage of flowering plants in any available database, we propose construction of a comprehensive database to facilitate large-scale comparative studies of angiosperm genomes and to promote the collaborative studies of important questions in plant biology.},

  abstract = {Many species are experiencing sustained environmental change mainly due to human activities. The unusual rate and extent of anthropogenic alterations of the environment may exceed the capacity of developmental, genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations have evolved to deal with environmental change. To begin to understand the limits to population persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model for the critical rate of environmental change beyond which a population must decline and go extinct. We use this model to highlight the major determinants of extinction risk in a changing environment, and identify research needs for improved predictions based on projected changes in environmental variables. Two key parameters relating the environment to population biology have not yet received sufficient attention. Phenotypic plasticity, the direct influence of environment on the development of individual phenotypes, is increasingly considered an important component of phenotypic change in the wild and should be incorporated in models of population persistence. Environmental sensitivity of selection, the change in the optimum phenotype with the environment, still crucially needs empirical assessment. We use environmental tolerance curves and other examples of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to illustrate how these mechanistic approaches can be developed for predictive purposes.},

  abstract = {Recombination and selection drive the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci and therefore affect the reshuffling of adaptive genetic variation. However, it is poorly known to what extent the enrichment of transposable elements (TEs) in recombinationally-inert regions reflects their inefficient removal by purifying selection and whether the presence of polymorphic TEs can modify the local recombination rate. In this study, we investigate how TEs and recombination interact at fine scale along chromosomes and possibly support linked selection in natural populations. Whole-genome sequencing data of 304 individuals from nearby alpine populations of Arabis alpina were used to show that the density of polymorphic TEs is specifically correlated with local LD along chromosomes. Consistent with TEs modifying recombination, the characterization of 28 such LD blocks of up to 5.5 Mb in length revealed strong evidence of selective sweeps at a few loci through either site frequency spectrum or haplotype structure. A majority of these blocks were enriched in genes related to ecologically relevant functions such as responses to cold, salt stress or photoperiodism. In particular, the S-locus (i.e., supergene responsible for strict outcrossing) was identified in a LD block with high levels of polymorphic TEs and evidence of selection. Another such LD block was enriched in cold-responding genes and presented evidence of adaptive loci related to photoperiodism and flowering being increasingly linked by polymorphic TEs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TEs modify recombination landscapes and thus interact with selection in driving blocks of linked adaptive loci in natural populations.},

Here, we catalogued genome variation in an annual soybean population by high-depth resequencing of 10 cultivated and 6 wild accessions and obtained 3.87 million high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after excluding the sites with missing data in any accession. Nuclear genome phylogeny supported a single origin for the cultivated soybeans. We identified 10-fold longer linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the wild soybean relative to wild maize and rice. Despite the small population size, the long LD and large SNP data allowed us to identify 206 candidate domestication regions with significantly lower diversity in the cultivated, but not in the wild, soybeans. Some of the genes in these candidate regions were associated with soybean homologues of canonical domestication genes. However, several examples, which are likely specific to soybean or eudicot crop plants, were also observed. Consequently, the variation data identified in this study should be valuable for breeding and for identifying agronomically important genes in soybeans. However, the long LD of wild soybeans may hinder pinpointing causal gene(s) in the candidate regions.},

To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in               Arabidopsis thaliana               , we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and {$\sim$}4\% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in               A. thaliana               .},

Here we contrast these LD maps to the classically derived, pedigree-based human recombination maps. The LD maps have a level of resolution greatly exceeding that of the pedigree maps, and at this fine scale, sperm typing allows a means of validation. While at a gross level both the pedigree maps and the sperm typing methods generally agree with LD maps, there are significant local differences between them, and the fact that these maps measure different genetic features should be remembered when using them for other genetic inferences.},

  abstract = {Many insect herbivores are vectors that transmit plant pathogens as they forage. Within food webs, vectors interact with a range of host plants, other herbivores, and predators. Yet, few studies have examined how tri-trophic interactions involving vectors affect the spread of pathogens. Here we assessed effects of food web structure on aphid vectors and the prevalence of an aphid-borne persistent pathogen (Pea enation mosaic virus, PEMV) in pea plants. We experimentally manipulated ladybird predators, alternative host plants, and non-vector herbivores and assessed responses of pea aphids and PEMV using structural equation models. We show that variation in bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal interactions mediated PEMV prevalence. Predators reduced PEMV prevalence by consuming aphids, but an alternative host plant (vetch) had the opposite effect by promoting aphid movement and abundance. Nonvector herbivores (pea leaf weevil) increased PEMV susceptibility in peas. In turn, weevils offset the positive effects of predators on PEMV, but increased the negative effects of vetch. Our results show that tri-trophic interactions within insect and plant food webs can mediate vector biology with synergistic and opposing effects on pathogens. Continuing to assess how community-wide interactions affect vectors will aid in our understanding of vector-borne pathosystems.},

  abstract = {In grasses such as rice or maize, the distribution of genic GC content is well known to be bimodal. It is mainly driven by GC content at third codon positions (GC3 for short). This feature is thought to be specific to grasses as closely related species like banana have a unimodal GC3 distribution. GC3 is associated with numerous genomics features and uncovering the origin of this peculiar distribution will help understanding the potential roles and consequences of GC3 variations within and between genomes. Until recently, the origin of the peculiar GC3 distribution in grasses has remained unknown. Thanks to the recent publication of several complete genomes and transcriptomes of nongrass monocots, we studied more than 1,000 groups of one-to-one orthologous genes in seven grasses and three outgroup species (banana, palm tree, and yam). Using a maximum likelihood-based method, we reconstructed GC3 at several ancestral nodes. We found that the bimodal GC3 distribution observed in extant grasses is ancestral to both grasses and most monocot species, and that other species studied here have lost this peculiar structure. We also found that GC3 in grass lineages is globally evolving very slowly and that the decreasing GC3 gradient observed from 50 to 30 along coding sequences is also conserved and ancestral to monocots. This result strongly challenges the previous views on the specificity of grass genomes and we discuss its implications for the possible causes of the evolution of GC content in monocots.},

  abstract = {Base composition is highly variable among and within plant genomes, especially at third codon positions, ranging from GC-poor and homogeneous species to GC-rich and highly heterogeneous ones (particularly Monocots). Consequently, synonymous codon usage is biased in most species, even when base composition is relatively homogeneous. The causes of these variations are still under debate, with three main forces being possibly involved: mutational bias, selection and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). So far, both selection and gBGC have been detected in some species but how their relative strength varies among and within species remains unclear. Population genetics approaches allow to jointly estimating the intensity of selection, gBGC and mutational bias. We extended a recently developed method and applied it to a large population genomic dataset based on transcriptome sequencing of 11 angiosperm species spread across the phylogeny. We found that at synonymous positions, base composition is far from mutation-drift equilibrium in most genomes and that gBGC is a widespread and stronger process than selection. gBGC could strongly contribute to base composition variation among plant species, implying that it should be taken into account in plant genome analyses, especially for GC-rich ones.},

To analyze another product of meiotic recombination, interhomolog noncrossovers (NCOs), we performed highresolution mapping of recombination events at an intensely active mouse hot spot in F1 hybrids derived from inbred mouse strains. We provide direct evidence that the vast majority of repair events are interhomolog NCOs, consistent with models in which frequent interhomolog interactions promote accurate chromosome pairing. NCOs peaked at the center of the hot spot but were also broadly distributed throughout. In some hybrid strains, localized zones within the hot spot were highly refractory to COs and showed elevated frequency of coconversion of adjacent polymorphisms in NCOs, raising the possibility of double-strand gap repair. Transmission distortion was observed in one hybrid, with NCOs providing a significant contribution. Thus, NCO recombination events play a substantial role in mammalian meiosis and genome evolution.},

  abstract = {The consequences of selection at linked sites are multiple and widespread across the genomes of most species. Here, I first review the main concepts behind models of selection and linkage in recombining genomes, present the difficulty in parametrizing these models simply as a reduction in effective population size (               N               e               ) and discuss the predicted impact of recombination rates on levels of diversity across genomes. Arguments are then put forward in favour of using a model of selection and linkage with neutral and deleterious mutations (i.e. the background selection model, BGS) as a sensible null hypothesis for investigating the presence of other forms of selection, such as balancing or positive. I also describe and compare two studies that have generated high-resolution landscapes of the predicted consequences of selection at linked sites in               Drosophila melanogaster               . Both studies show that BGS can explain a very large fraction of the observed variation in diversity across the whole genome, thus supporting its use as null model. Finally, I identify and discuss a number of caveats and challenges in studies of genetic hitchhiking that have been often overlooked, with several of them sharing a potential bias towards overestimating the evidence supporting recent selective sweeps to the detriment of a BGS explanation. One potential source of bias is the analysis of non-equilibrium populations: it is precisely because models of selection and linkage predict variation in               N               e               across chromosomes that demographic dynamics are not expected to be equivalent chromosome- or genome-wide. Other challenges include the use of incomplete genome annotations, the assumption of temporally stable recombination landscapes, the presence of genes under balancing selection and the consequences of ignoring non-crossover (gene conversion) recombination events.

This correlation is not likely to be the result of mutational processes alone: evolutionary analysis of intron length polymorphism in D. melanogaster reveals equivalent ratios of deletion to insertion in regions of high and low recombination. The polymorphism data do reveal, however, an excess of deletions relative to insertions (i.e., a deletion bias), with an overall deletion-to-insertion events ratio of 1.35. We propose two types of selection favoring longer intron lengths. First, the natural mutational bias toward deletion must be opposed by strong selection in very short introns to maintain the minimum intron length needed for the intron splicing reaction. Second, selection will favor insertions in introns that increase recombination between mutations under the influence of selection in adjacent exons. Mutations that increase recombination, even slightly, will be selectively favored because they reduce interference among selected mutations. Interference selection acting on intron length mutations must be very weak, as indicated by frequency spectrum analysis of Drosophila intron length polymorphism, making the equilibrium for intron length sensitive to changes in the recombinational environment and population size. One consequence of this sensitivity is that the advantage of longer introns is expected to decrease inversely with the rate of recombination, thus leading to a negative correlation between intron length and recombination rate. Also in accord with this model, intron length differs between closely related Drosophila species, with the longest variant present more often in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans.

  abstract = {Abstract             Evolutionary analysis of codon bias in Drosophila indicates that synonymous mutations are not neutral, but rather are subject to weak selection at the translation level. Here we show that the effectiveness of natural selection on synonymous sites is strongly correlated with the rate of recombination, in accord with the nearly neutral hypothesis. This correlation, however, is apparent only in genes encoding short proteins. Long coding regions have both a lower codon bias and higher synonymous substitution rates, suggesting that they are affected less efficiently by selection. Therefore, both the length of the coding region and the recombination rate modulate codon bias. In addition, the data indicate that selection coefficients for synonymous mutations must vary by a minimum of one or two orders of magnitude. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the relationship among the coding region length, the codon bias, and the synonymous divergence and polymorphism levels across the range of recombination rates in Drosophila. The first hypothesis is that selection coefficients on synonymous mutations are inversely related to the total length of the coding region. The second hypothesis proposes that interference among synonymous mutations reduces the efficacy of selection on these mutations. We investigated this second hypothesis by carrying out forward simulations of weakly selected mutations in model populations. These simulations show that even with realistic recombination rates, this interference, which we call the ``small-scale'' Hill-Robertson effect, can have a moderately strong influence on codon bias.},

Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow ``hotspots.'' To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60\% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way toward providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently available.},

  abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that the amount of neutral polymorphisms within a species will increase proportionally with the census population size (Nc). However, this prediction has not been borne out in practice: while the range of Nc spans many orders of magnitude, levels of genetic diversity within species fall in a comparatively narrow range. Although theoretical arguments have invoked the increased efficacy of natural selection in larger populations to explain this discrepancy, few direct empirical tests of this hypothesis have been conducted. In this work, we provide a direct test of this hypothesis using population genomic data from a wide range of taxonomically diverse species. To do this, we relied on the fact that the impact of natural selection on linked neutral diversity depends on the local recombinational environment. In regions of relatively low recombination, selected variants affect more neutral sites through linkage, and the resulting correlation between recombination and polymorphism allows a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of the impact of selection on linked neutral diversity. By comparing whole-genome polymorphism data and genetic maps using a coalescent modeling framework, we estimate the degree to which natural selection reduces linked neutral diversity for 40 species of obligately sexual eukaryotes. We then show that the magnitude of the impact of natural selection is positively correlated with Nc, based on body size and species range as proxies for census population size. These results demonstrate that natural selection removes more variation at linked neutral sites in species with large Nc than those with small Nc, and provides direct empirical evidence that natural selection constrains levels of neutral genetic diversity across many species. This implies that natural selection may provide an explanation for this longstanding paradox of population genetics.},

Due to the diversity of applications, many techniques for measuring correlations have been designed. Here, we study systematically the influence of the length of a time series on the results obtained from several techniques commonly used to detect and quantify long-range correlations: the autocorrelation analysis, Hurst's analysis, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Using the Fourier filtering method, we generate artificial time series with known and controlled long-range correlations and with a broad range of lengths, and apply on them the different correlation measures we have studied. Our results indicate that while the DFA method is practically unaffected by the length of the time series, and almost always provides accurate results, the results from Hurst's analysis and the autocorrelation analysis strongly depend on the length of the time series.},

  abstract = {Background: The application of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approaches, combined with data imputation methodologies, is narrowing the genetic knowledge gap between major and understudied, minor crops. GBS is an excellent tool to characterize the genomic structure of recently domesticated ({\textasciitilde}200 years) and understudied species, such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.), by generating large numbers of markers for genomic studies such as genetic mapping. Results: We identified 10842 potentially mappable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cranberry pseudo-testcross population wherein 5477 SNPs and 211 short sequence repeats (SSRs) were used to construct a high density linkage map in cranberry of which a total of 4849 markers were mapped. Recombination frequency, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and segregation distortion at the genomic level in the parental and integrated linkage maps were characterized for first time in cranberry. SSR markers, used as the backbone in the map, revealed high collinearity with previously published linkage maps. The 4849 point map consisted of twelve linkage groups spanning 1112 cM, which anchored 2381 nuclear scaffolds accounting for {\textasciitilde}13 Mb of the estimated 470 Mb cranberry genome. Bin mapping identified 592 and 672 unique bins in the parentals and a total of 1676 unique marker positions in the integrated map. Synteny analyses comparing the order of anchored cranberry scaffolds to their homologous positions in kiwifruit, grape, and coffee genomes provided initial evidence of homology between cranberry and closely related species. Conclusions: GBS data was used to rapidly saturate the cranberry genome with markers in a pseudo-testcross population. Collinearity between the present saturated genetic map and previous cranberry SSR maps suggests that the SNP locations represent accurate marker order and chromosome structure of the cranberry genome. SNPs greatly improved current marker genome coverage, which allowed for genome-wide structure investigations such as segregation distortion, recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and synteny analyses. In the future, GBS can be used to accelerate cranberry molecular breeding through QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).},

  abstract = {Background: Recombination rates vary at the level of the species, population and individual. Now recognized as a transient feature of the genome, recombination rates at a given locus can change markedly over time. Existing inferential methods, predominantly based on linkage disequilibrium patterns, return a long-term average estimate of past recombination rates. Such estimates can be misleading, but no analytical framework to infer recombination rates that have changed over time is currently available. Results: We apply coalescent modeling in conjunction with a suite of summary statistics to show that the recombination history of a locus can be reconstructed from a time series of genetic samples. More usefully, we describe a new method, based on n-tuple dataset subsampling, to infer past changes in recombination rate from DNA sequences taken at a single time point. This subsampling strategy can correctly assign simulated loci to constant, increasing and decreasing recombination models with an accuracy of 84\%. Conclusions: While providing an important stepping-stone to determining past recombination rates, n-tuple subsampling still exhibits a moderate error rate. Theoretical limitations indicated by coalescent theory suggest that highly accurate inference of past recombination rates will remain challenging. Nevertheless, we show for the first time that reconstructing historic recombination rates is possible in principle.},

This polymorphism is puzzling: because crossing over in female heterokaryotypes produces inviable zygotes, such inversions are thought to be underdominant and should be quickly eliminated from populations. The observed fixation for such inversions among related species has led to the idea that genetic drift can cause chromosome evolution in opposition to natural selection. We found, however, that In(2LR)PL is not underdominant for fertility, as heterokaryotypic females produce perfectly viable eggs. Genetic analysis shows that the lack of underdominance results from the nearly complete absence of crossing over in the inverted region. This phenomenon is probably caused by mechanical and not genetic factors, because crossing over is not suppressed in In(2LR)PL homokaryotypes. Our observations do not support the idea that the fixation of pericentric inversions among closely related species implies the action of genetic drift overcoming strong natural selection in very small populations. If chromosome arrangements vary in their underdominance, it is those with the least disadvantage as heterozygotes, like In(2LR)PL, that will be polymorphic or fixed in natural populations.},

The homolog of the human               Fanconi anemia complementation group M (FANCM)               helicase protein was found to be a major meiotic anti-recombinase, which could drive meiotic recombination intermediates into the non-crossover pathway.                        ,              A homolog of a human Fanconi anemia complementation group protein is involved in controlling crossing over during meiosis.           ,                             The number of meiotic crossovers (COs) is tightly regulated within a narrow range, despite a large excess of molecular precursors. The factors that limit COs remain largely unknown. Here, using a genetic screen in               Arabidopsis thaliana               , we identified the highly conserved FANCM helicase, which is required for genome stability in humans and yeasts, as a major factor limiting meiotic CO formation. The               fancm               mutant has a threefold-increased CO frequency as compared to the wild type. These extra COs arise not from the pathway that accounts for most of the COs in wild type, but from an alternate, normally minor pathway. Thus, FANCM is a key factor imposing an upper limit on the number of meiotic COs, and its manipulation holds much promise for plant breeding.},

  abstract = {The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is especially well-suited for both genetic and biochemical analysis of meiotic recombination. Recent studies have revealed {\textasciitilde}50 gene products and two DNA intermediates central to recombination, which we place into a pathway from parental to recombinant DNA. We divide recombination into three stages {\textendash} chromosome alignment accompanying nuclear ``horsetail'' movement, formation of DNA breaks, and repair of those breaks {\textendash} and we discuss the roles of the identified gene products and DNA intermediates in these stages. Although some aspects of recombination are similar to those in the distantly related budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other aspects are distinctly different. In particular, many proteins required for recombination in one species have no clear ortholog in the other, and the roles of identified orthologs in regulating recombination often differ. Furthermore, in S. pombe the dominant joint DNA molecule intermediates contain single Holliday junctions, and intersister joint molecules are more frequent than interhomolog types, whereas in S. cerevisiae interhomolog double Holliday junctions predominate. We speculate that meiotic recombination in other organisms shares features of each of these yeasts.},

  abstract = {The metaphor of `genomic islands of speciation' was first used to describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed to explain these differences was that the regions showing high levels of differentiation were resistant to gene flow between species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized by gene flow and consequently showed lower levels of differentiation. However, the conditions under which such differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses have been carried out using relative measures of divergence, which can be misleading when regions with different levels of recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of differential gene flow by asking whether absolute divergence is also higher in the previously identified `islands'. Using five species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we find that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we find reduced diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data therefore do not support a model of differential gene flow among loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci involved in local adaptation. Simulations using the program IMa2 further suggest that inferences of any gene flow may be incorrect in many comparisons. We instead present an alternative explanation for heterogeneous patterns of differentiation, one in which postspeciation selection generates patterns consistent with multiple aspects of the data.},

We discovered distinct differences in the number of average polymorphisms between landraces and modern wheat cultivars, and identified a set of novel rare alleles present at low frequencies in the landrace collection. The detected polymorphisms were unevenly distributed along the wheat genome, and polymorphic markers co-localized with genes of great agronomic importance. The geographical distribution of the inferred Bayesian clustering revealed six genetically homogenous ancestral groups among the collection, where the Central European core bared an admixed background originating from four ancestral groups. We evaluated the effective population sizes (               N               e) of the Central European collection and assessed changes in diversity over time, which revealed a dramatic\,{\textasciitilde}\,97\% genetic erosion between 1955 and 2015.},

HR occurs in the context of meiotic chromosome axes and the synaptonemal complex. To study the role of axis remodelling in crossover (CO) formation in a crop species, we characterized mutants of the axis-associated protein ASY1 and the axis-remodelling protein PCH2 in Brassica rapa. asy1 plants form meiotic chromosome axes that fail to synapse. CO formation is almost abolished, and residual chiasmata are proportionally enriched in terminal chromosome regions, particularly in the nucleolar organizing region (NOR)-carrying chromosome arm. pch2 plants show impaired ASY1 loading and remodelling, consequently achieving only partial synapsis, which leads to reduced CO formation and loss of the obligatory CO. PCH2-independent chiasmata are proportionally enriched towards distal chromosome regions. Similarly, in Arabidopsis pch2, COs are increased towards telomeric regions at the expense of (peri-) centromeric COs compared with the wild type. Taken together, in B. rapa, axis formation and remodelling are critical for meiotic fidelity including synapsis and CO formation, and in asy1 and pch2 CO distributions are altered. While asy1 plants are sterile, pch2 plants are semi-sterile and thus PCH2 could be an interesting target for breeding programmes.},

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in particular, has injected both insights and confusion into this topic, as an early system subject to genomic analysis with subsequent conflicting reports. Here, we revisit the role of recombination in mutation and selection with recent genomewide maps of population polymorphism and recombination for S. cerevisiae. We confirm that recombination-associated mutation does not leave a genomic signature in yeast and conclude that a previously observed, enigmatic, negative recombination{\textendash}divergence correlation is largely a consequence of weak selection and other genomic covariates. We also corroborate the presence of biased gene conversion from patterns of polymorphism. Moreover, we identify significant positive relations between recombination and population polymorphism at putatively neutrally evolving sites, independent of other factors and the genomic scale of interrogation. We conclude that widespread natural selection across the yeast genome has left its imprint on segregating genetic variation, but that this signature is much weaker than in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis.},

  abstract = {In some species, meiotic recombination is concentrated in small genomic regions. These ``recombination hotspots'' leave signatures in fine-scale patterns of linkage disequilibrium, raising the prospect that the genomic landscape of hotspots can be characterized from sequence variation. This approach has led to the inference that hotspots evolve rapidly in some species, but are conserved in others. Historic demographic events, such as population bottlenecks, are known to affect patterns of linkage disequilibrium across the genome, violating population genetic assumptions of this approach. Although such events are prevalent, demographic history is generally ignored when making inferences about the evolution of recombination hotspots. To determine the effect of demography on the detection of recombination hotspots, we use the coalescent to simulate haplotypes with a known recombination landscape. We measure the ability of popular linkage disequilibrium-based programs to detect hotspots across a range of demographic histories, including population bottlenecks, hidden population structure, population expansions, and population contractions. We find that demographic events have the potential to greatly reduce the power and increase the false positive rate of hotspot discovery. Neither the power nor the false positive rate of hotspot detection can be predicted without also knowing the demographic history of the sample. Our results suggest that ignoring demographic history likely overestimates the power to detect hotspots and therefore underestimates the degree of hotspot sharing between species. We suggest strategies for incorporating demographic history into population genetic inferences about recombination hotspots.},

  abstract = {Although it is well established theoretically that selective interference among mutations (Hill{\textendash}Robertson interference) favours meiotic recombination, genomewide mean rates of mutation and strengths of selection appear too low to support this as the mechanism favouring recombination in nature. A possible solution to this discrepancy between theory and observation is that selection is at least intermittently very strong due to the antagonistic coevolution between a host and its parasites. The Red Queen theory posits that such coevolution generates fitness epistasis among loci, which generates negative linkage disequilibrium among beneficial mutations, which in turn favours recombination. This theory has received only limited support. However, Red Queen dynamics without epistasis may provide the ecological conditions that maintain strong and frequent selective interference in finite populations that indirectly selects for recombination. This hypothesis is developed here through the simulation of Red Queen dynamics. This approach required the development of a method to calculate the exact frequencies of multilocus haplotypes after recombination. Simulations show that recombination is favoured by the moderately weak selection of many loci involved in the interaction between a host and its parasites, which results in substitution rates that are compatible with empirical estimates. The model also reproduces the previously reported rapid increase in the rate of outcrossing in Caenorhabditis elegans coevolving with a bacterial pathogen.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination initiated by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) yields two types of interhomolog recombination products, crossovers and noncrossovers, but what determines whether a DSB will yield a crossover or noncrossover is not understood. In this study, we analyzed the influence of sex and chromosomal location on mammalian recombination outcomes by constructing fine-scale recombination maps in both males and females at two mouse hot spots located in different regions of the same chromosome. These include the most comprehensive maps of recombination hot spots in oocytes to date. One hot spot, located centrally on chromosome 1, behaved similarly in male and female meiosis: Crossovers and noncrossovers formed at comparable levels and ratios in both sexes. In contrast, at a distal hot spot, crossovers were recovered only in males even though noncrossovers were obtained at similar frequencies in both sexes. These findings reveal an example of extreme sex-specific bias in recombination outcome. We further found that estimates of relative DSB levels are surprisingly poor predictors of relative crossover frequencies between hot spots in males. Our results demonstrate that the outcome of mammalian meiotic recombination can be biased, that this bias can vary depending on location and cellular context, and that DSB frequency is not the only determinant of crossover frequency.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences. Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence space (oligo ``clouds''). We show here that P-clouds predicts .840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome, thus suggesting that 66\%{\textendash}69\% of the human genome is repetitive or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (,25 bp). Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation that reflects this fact. We further developed ``element-specific'' P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ,100 Mb of previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive sequence than previously believed.},

  abstract = {Background: Salinity is one of the many abiotic stresses limiting rice production worldwide. Several studies were conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for traits associated to salinity tolerance. However, due to large confidence interval for the position of QTLs, utility of reported QTLs and the associated markers has been limited in rice breeding programs. The main objective of this study is to construct a high-density rice genetic map for identification QTLs and candidate genes for salinity tolerance at seedling stage. Results: We evaluated a population of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between Bengal and Pokkali for nine traits related to salinity tolerance. A total of 9303 SNP markers generated by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) were mapped to 2817 recombination points. The genetic map had a total map length of 1650 cM with an average resolution of 0.59 cM between markers. For nine traits, a total of 85 additive QTLs were identified, of which, 16 were large-effect QTLs and the rest were small-effect QTLs. The average interval size of QTL was about 132 kilo base pairs (Kb). Eleven of the 85 additive QTLs validated 14 reported QTLs for shoot potassium concentration, sodium-potassium ratio, salt injury score, plant height, and shoot dry weight. Epistatic QTL mapping identified several pairs of QTLs that significantly contributed to the variation of traits. The QTL for high shoot K+ concentration was mapped near the qSKC1 region. However, candidate genes within the QTL interval were a CC-NBS-LRR protein, three uncharacterized genes, and transposable elements. Additionally, many QTLs flanked small chromosomal intervals containing few candidate genes. Annotation of the genes located within QTL intervals indicated that ion transporters, osmotic regulators, transcription factors, and protein kinases may play essential role in various salt tolerance mechanisms. Conclusion: The saturation of SNP markers in our linkage map increased the resolution of QTL mapping. Our study offers new insights on salinity tolerance and presents useful candidate genes that will help in marker-assisted gene pyramiding to develop salt tolerant rice varieties.},

It has been proposed that the regular spacing of the DNA loops, along with the close relationship of the recombination complexes and the meiotic axes are at the basis of this covariation. Here, we use a cytogenomic approach to investigate the relationship between the synaptonemal complex length and the DNA content in chicken oocytes during the pachytene stage of the first meiotic prophase. The synaptonemal complex to DNA ratios of specific chromosomes and chromosome segments were compared against the recombination rates obtained by MLH1 focus mapping. The present results show variations in the DNA packing ratios of macro- and microbivalents and also between regions within the same bivalent. Chromosome or chromosome regions with higher crossover rates form comparatively longer synaptonemal complexes than expected based on their DNA content. These observations are compatible with the formation of higher number of shorter DNA loops along meiotic axes in regions with higher recombination levels.},

  abstract = {In the zebra finch, 2 alternative morphs regarding centromere position were described for chromosome 6. This polymorphism was interpreted to be the result of a pericentric inversion, but other causes of the centromere repositioning were not ruled out. We used immunofluorescence localization to examine the distribution of MLH1 foci on synaptonemal complexes to test the prediction that pericentric inversions cause synaptic irregularities and/or crossover suppression in heterozygotes. We found complete suppression of crossing over in the region involved in the rearrangement in male and female heterozygotes. In contrast, the same region showed high levels of crossing over in homozygotes for the acrocentric form of this chromosome. No inversion loops or synaptic irregularities were detected along bivalent 6 in heterozygotes suggesting that heterologous pairing is achieved during zygotene or early pachytene. Altogether these findings strongly indicate that the polymorphic chromosome 6 originated by a pericentric inversion. Since inversions are common rearrangements in karyotypic evolution in birds, it seems likely that early heterologous pairing could help to fix these rearrangements, preventing crossing overs in heterozygotes and their deleterious effects on fertility.},

This process also creates new combinations of alleles and has important consequences for genome evolution. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired by homologous recombination. DSBs are catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved SPO11 protein, assisted by several other factors. Some of them are absolutely required, whereas others are needed only for full levels of DSB formation and may participate in the regulation of DSB timing and frequency as well as the coordination between DSB formation and repair. The sites where DSBs occur are not randomly distributed in the genome, and remarkably distinct strategies have emerged to control their localization in different species. Here, I review the recent advances in the components required for DSB formation and localization in the various model organisms in which these studies have been performed.},

  abstract = {Genetic maps order genetic markers along chromosomes. They are, for instance, extensively used in marker-assisted selection to accelerate breeding programs. Even for the same species, people often have to deal with several alternative maps obtained using different ordering methods or different datasets, e.g. resulting from different segregating populations. Having efficient tools to identify the consistency and discrepancy of alternative maps is thus essential to facilitate genetic map comparisons. We propose to encode genetic maps by bucket order, a kind of order, which takes into account the blurred parts of the marker order while being an efficient data structure to achieve low complexity algorithms. The main result of this paper is an O(n log(n)) procedure to identify the largest agreements between two bucket orders of n elements, their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), providing an efficient solution to highlight discrepancies between two genetic maps. The LCS of two maps, being the largest set of their collinear markers, is used as a building block to compute pairwise map congruence, to visually emphasize maker collinearity and in some scaffolding methods relying on genetic maps to improve genome assembly. As the LCS computation is a key subroutine of all these genetic map related tools, replacing the current LCS subroutine of those methods by ours {\textendash}to do the exact same work but faster{\textendash} could significantly speed up those methods without changing their accuracy. To ease such transition we provide all required algorithmic details in this self contained paper as well as an R package implementing them, named LCSLCIS, which is freely available at: https://github.com/holtzy/LCSLCIS.},

Owing to direct and reverse genetic screens, an increasing number of genes involved in meiosis have been characterized in plants. In parallel, the improvement of cytological and genetical tools has allowed a precise description of meiotic recombination events. Thus, it appears that meiotic studies in plants are reaching a new stage and can provide new insights into meiotic recombination mechanisms. In this review, we intend to give an overview of these recent advances in the understanding of meiotic recombination in plants.},

In the HIS4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most mutant alleles at the 5' end of the gene have a higher rate of meiotic recombination (gene conversion) than mutant alleles at the 3' end of the gene. Such gradients are usually interpreted as indicating a higher frequency of heteroduplex formation at the high conversion end of the gene. We present evidence indicating that the gradient of conversion at HIS4 primarily reflects the direction of mismatch repair rather than the frequency of heteroduplex formation. We also identify a site located between the 5' end of HIS4 and the 3' end of BIK1 that stimulates heteroduplex formation at HIS4 and BIK1.},

In order to investigate the level of statistical support and the accuracy of the genetic maps compared to sequence-based physical maps, two {\textasciitilde}30 cM autosomal regions were selected. The first region was selected from chromosome 3 and consisted predominately of draft sequence. The second region was selected from chromosome 21 and consisted of finished sequence data. The physical order of these markers was based upon their position on Celera (CEL) and Human Genome Project-Santa Cruz (HGP-sc) sequence-based physical maps. The chromosome 3 and 21 regions contained 100 and 61 markers, respectively, on the Marshfield genetic map. The genetic and physical map order was consistent for 88.9 and 89.2\% of the markers in the region on chromosome 3 and 21, respectively. Using a novel scoring criterion to assess inconsistent marker order between genetic and physical maps, it was determined that the physical order was likely the correct order for 3.3 and 7.1\% of the markers in the chromosome 3 and 21 regions, respectively. To increase the accuracy of the order of markers selected for fine mapping a method is presented which combines information from genetic and sequence-based physical maps.},

  abstract = {Background: A number of molecular marker linkage maps have been developed for melon (Cucumis melo L.) over the last two decades. However, these maps were constructed using different marker sets, thus, making comparative analysis among maps difficult. In order to solve this problem, a consensus genetic map in melon was constructed using primarily highly transferable anchor markers that have broad potential use for mapping, synteny, and comparative quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, increasing breeding effectiveness and efficiency via markerassisted selection (MAS). Results: Under the framework of the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative (ICuGI, http://www.icugi.org), an integrated genetic map has been constructed by merging data from eight independent mapping experiments using a genetically diverse array of parental lines. The consensus map spans 1150 cM across the 12 melon linkage groups and is composed of 1592 markers (640 SSRs, 330 SNPs, 252 AFLPs, 239 RFLPs, 89 RAPDs, 15 IMAs, 16 indels and 11 morphological traits) with a mean marker density of 0.72 cM/marker. One hundred and ninety-six of these markers (157 SSRs, 32 SNPs, 6 indels and 1 RAPD) were newly developed, mapped or provided by industry representatives as released markers, including 27 SNPs and 5 indels from genes involved in the organic acid metabolism and transport, and 58 EST-SSRs. Additionally, 85 of 822 SSR markers contributed by Syngenta Seeds were included in the integrated map. In addition, 370 QTL controlling 62 traits from 18 previously reported mapping experiments using genetically diverse parental genotypes were also integrated into the consensus map. Some QTL associated with economically important traits detected in separate studies mapped to similar genomic positions. For example, independently identified QTL controlling fruit shape were mapped on similar genomic positions, suggesting that such QTL are possibly responsible for the phenotypic variability observed for this trait in a broad array of melon germplasm. Conclusions: Even though relatively unsaturated genetic maps in a diverse set of melon market types have been published, the integrated saturated map presented herein should be considered the initial reference map for melon. Most of the mapped markers contained in the reference map are polymorphic in diverse collection of},

  abstract = {Temperate grasses belonging to the Festuca{\textendash}Lolium complex are important throughout the world in pasture and grassland agriculture. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is the predominant species in the United States, covering approximately 15 million ha. Tall fescue has distinctive morphotypes, two of which are Continental (summer active) and Mediterranean (summer semidormant). This is the first report of a linkage map created for Mediterranean tall fescue, while updating the Continental map with additional simple sequence repeat and sequence-tagged site markers. Additionally, this is the first time that diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers were used in the construction of a tall fescue map. The male parent (Continental), R43-64, map consisted of 594 markers arranged in 22 linkage groups (LGs) and covered a total of 1577 cM. The female parent (Mediterranean), 103-2, map was shorter (1258 cM) and consisted of only 208 markers arranged in 29 LGs. Marker densities for R43-64 and 103-2 were 2.65 and 6.08 cM per marker, respectively. When compared with the other Poaceae species, meadow fescue (F. pratensis Huds.), annual ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), perennial ryegrass (L. perenne L.), Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv., and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a total of 171 and 98 orthologous or homologous sequences, identified by DArT analysis, were identified in R43-64 and 103-2, respectively. By using genomic in situ hybridization, we aimed to identify potential progenitors of both morphotypes. However, no clear conclusion on genomic constitution was reached. These maps will aid in the search for quantitative trait loci of various traits as well as help define and distinguish genetic differences between the two morphotypes.},

  abstract = {It is believed that recombination in meiosis serves to reshuffle genetic material from both parents to increase genetic variation in the progeny. At the same time, the number of crossovers is usually kept at a very low level. As a consequence, many organisms need to make the best possible use from the one or two crossovers that occur per chromosome in meiosis. From this perspective, the decision of where to allocate rare crossover events becomes an important issue, especially in self-pollinating plant species, which experience limited variation due to inbreeding. However, the freedom in crossover allocation is significantly limited by other, genetic and non-genetic factors, including chromatin structure. Here we summarize recent progress in our understanding of those processes with a special emphasis on plant genomes. First, we focus on factors which influence the distribution of recombination initiation sites and discuss their effects at both, the single hotspot level and at the chromosome scale. We also briefly explain the aspects of hotspot evolution and their regulation. Next, we analyze how recombination initiation sites translate into the development of crossovers and their location. Moreover, we provide an overview of the sequence polymorphism impact on crossover formation and chromosomal distribution.},

But it is unclear whether this pattern reflects a reduction in the efficacy of selection against deleterious insertions or a relaxation of ectopic recombination. Discriminating between these two hypotheses has been difficult, because no formal model has investigated the effects of recombination under the deleterious insertion model. Here we take a simulation-based approach to analyze this scenario and determine the conditions under which element accumulation is expected in low recombination regions. We show that TEs become fixed as a result of Hill{\textendash}Robertson effects in the form of Muller's ratchet, but only in regions of extremely low recombination when excision is effectively absent and synergism between elements is weak. These results have important implications for differentiating between the leading models of how selection acts on TEs and should help to interpret emerging population genetic and genomic data.},

However, due to the deficiency of genomic data and high-quality molecular markers, no genetic map has been published for Prince Rupprecht's larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr), a conifer species with high ecological and commercial value in northern China. In this study, 145 F1 progeny individuals from an intraspecific cross between two elite clones of L. principis-rupprechtii and their parents were employed to construct the first genetic map in this important tree species using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). After preprocessing, the procedure yielded 300.20 Gb of raw data containing 1501.22 M pair-end reads. A total of 324,352 SNP markers were detected and 122,785 of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of 37.86\%. Ultimately, 6099 SNPs were organized into a genetic map containing 12 linkage groups, consistent with the haploid chromosome number of larch and most other species in the Pinaceae family. The linkage map spanned 2415.58 cM and covered 99.6\% of the L. principis-rupprechtii genome with an average of 0.4 cM between adjacent markers. To the best of our knowledge, this map is the first reference map for L. principis-rupprechtii, as well as the densest one obtained in larch species thus far. The genome-wide SNPs and the high-resolution genetic map will provide a foundation for future quantitative trait loci mapping, map-based cloning, marker-assisted selection, comparative genomics, and genome sequence assembly for larch trees.},

While there is evidence for widespread declines from population surveys, assemblage surveys reveal a mix of declines and increases. These conflicting conclusions may be caused by the use of different metrics: assemblage metrics may average out drastic changes in individual populations. Alternatively, differences may arise from data sources: populations monitored individually, versus whole-assemblage monitoring. To test these hypotheses, we estimated population change metrics using assemblage data. For a set of 23 241 populations, 16 009 species, in 158 assemblages, we detected significantly accelerating extinction and colonisation rates, with both rates being approximately balanced. Most populations (85\%) did not show significant trends in abundance, and those that did were balanced between winners (8\%) and losers (7\%). Thus, population metrics estimated with assemblage data are commensurate with assemblage metrics and reveal sustained and increasing species turnover.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Plants have undergone repeated rounds of whole-genome duplication, followed by gene degeneration and loss. Using whole-genome resequencing, we examined the origins of the recent tetraploid               Capsella bursa-pastoris               and the earliest stages of genome evolution after polyploidization. We conclude the species had a hybrid origin from two distinct               Capsella               lineages within the past 100,000{\textendash}300,000 y. Our analyses suggest the absence of rapid gene loss but provide evidence that the species has large numbers of inactivating mutations, many of which were inherited from the parental species. Our results suggest that genome evolution following polyploidy is determined not only by genome redundancy but also by demography, the mating system, and the evolutionary history of the parental species.                        ,                             Whole-genome duplication (WGD) events have occurred repeatedly during flowering plant evolution, and there is growing evidence for predictable patterns of gene retention and loss following polyploidization. Despite these important insights, the rate and processes governing the earliest stages of diploidization remain poorly understood, and the relative importance of genetic drift, positive selection, and relaxed purifying selection in the process of gene degeneration and loss is unclear. Here, we conduct whole-genome resequencing in               Capsella bursa-pastoris               , a recently formed tetraploid with one of the most widespread species distributions of any angiosperm. Whole-genome data provide strong support for recent hybrid origins of the tetraploid species within the past 100,000{\textendash}300,000 y from two diploid progenitors in the               Capsella               genus. Major-effect inactivating mutations are frequent, but many were inherited from the parental species and show no evidence of being fixed by positive selection. Despite a lack of large-scale gene loss, we observe a decrease in the efficacy of natural selection genome-wide due to the combined effects of demography, selfing, and genome redundancy from WGD. Our results suggest that the earliest stages of diploidization are associated with quantitative genome-wide decreases in the strength and efficacy of selection rather than rapid gene loss, and that nonfunctionalization can receive a ``head start'' through a legacy of deleterious variants and differential expression originating in parental diploid populations.},

  abstract = {The parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus is an economically and clinically important pathogen of small ruminants, and a model system for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of traits such as anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintic resistance is widespread and is a major threat to the sustainability of livestock agriculture globally; however, little is known about the genome architecture and parameters such as recombination that will ultimately influence the rate at which resistance may evolve and spread. Here, we performed a genetic cross between two divergent strains of H. contortus, and subsequently used whole-genome resequencing of a female worm and her brood to identify the distribution of genomewide variation that characterizes these strains. Using a novel bioinformatic approach to identify variants that segregate as expected in a pseudotestcross, we characterized linkage groups and estimated genetic distances between markers to generate a chromosome-scale F1 genetic map. We exploited this map to reveal the recombination landscape, the first for any helminth species, demonstrating extensive variation in recombination rate within and between chromosomes. Analyses of these data also revealed the extent of polyandry, whereby at least eight males were found to have contributed to the genetic variation of the progeny analyzed. Triploid offspring were also identified, which we hypothesize are the result of nondisjunction during female meiosis or polyspermy. These results expand our knowledge of the genetics of parasitic helminths and the unusual life-history of H. contortus, and enhance ongoing efforts to understand the genetic basis of resistance to the drugs used to control these worms and for related species that infect livestock and humans throughout the world. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using whole-genome resequencing data to directly construct a genetic map in a single generation cross from a noninbred nonmodel organism with a complex lifecycle.},

  abstract = {We examined fixed substitutions in the human lineage since divergence from the common ancestor with the chimpanzee, and determined what fraction are AT to GC (weak-to-strong). Substitutions that are densely clustered on the chromosomes show a remarkable excess of weak-to-strong ``biased'' substitutions. These unexpected biased clustered substitutions (UBCS) are common near the telomeres of all autosomes but not the sex chromosomes. Regions of extreme bias are enriched for genes. Human and chimp orthologous regions show a striking similarity in the shape and magnitude of their respective UBCS maps, suggesting a relatively stable force leads to clustered bias. The strong and stable signal near telomeres may have participated in the evolution of isochores. One exception to the UBCS pattern found in all autosomes is chromosome 2, which shows a UBCS peak midchromosome, mapping to the fusion site of two ancestral chromosomes. This provides evidence that the fusion occurred as recently as 740,000 years ago and no more than {$\sim$}3 million years ago. No biased clustering was found in SNPs, suggesting that clusters of biased substitutions are selected from mutations. UBCS is strongly correlated with male (and not female) recombination rates, which explains the lack of UBCS signal on chromosome X. These observations support the hypothesis that biased gene conversion (BGC), specifically in the male germline, played a significant role in the evolution of the human genome.},

Here, using a new molecular approach in plants, called ``pollen-typing'', we detected and characterized hundreds of CO and NCO molecules in two different hotspot regions in Arabidopsis thaliana. This analysis revealed that COs are concentrated in regions of a few kilobases where their rates reach up to 50 times the genome average. The hotspots themselves tend to cluster in regions less than 8 kilobases in size with overlapping CO distribution. Non-crossover (NCO) events also occurred in the two hotspots but at very different levels (local CO/NCO ratios of 1/1 and 30/1) and their track lengths were quite small (a few hundred base pairs). We also showed that the ZMM protein MSH4 plays a role in CO formation and somewhat unexpectedly we also found that it is involved in the generation of NCOs but with a different level of effect. Finally, factors acting in cis and in trans appear to shape the rate and distribution of COs at meiotic recombination hotspots.},

In human genetics, phasing most often exploits population information (linkage disequilibrium), while in animal genetics the primary source of information is familial (Mendelian segregation and linkage). We herein develop and evaluate a method that simultaneously exploits both sources of information. It builds on hidden Markov models that were initially developed to exploit population information only. We demonstrate that the approach improves the accuracy of allele phasing as well as imputation of missing genotypes. Reconstructed haplotypes are assigned to hidden states that are shown to correspond to clusters of genealogically related chromosomes. We show that these cluster states can directly be used to fine map QTL. The method is computationally effective at handling large data sets based on high-density SNP panels.},

Here, we compare recombination of the distantly related {$\beta$}-lactamases PSE-4 and TEM-1 to mutation of PSE-4. We show that, among {$\beta$}-lactamase variants containing the same number of amino acid substitutions, variants created by recombination retain function with a significantly higher probability than those generated by random mutagenesis. We present a simple model that accurately captures the differing effects of mutation and recombination in real and simulated proteins with only four parameters: (               i               ) the amino acid sequence distance between parents, (               ii               ) the number of substitutions, (               iii               ) the average probability that random substitutions will preserve function, and (               iv               ) the average probability that substitutions generated by recombination will preserve function.

  abstract = {The availability of complete or nearly complete genome sequences from several plant species permits detailed discovery and cross-species comparison of transposable elements (TEs) at the whole genome level. We initially investigated 510 long terminal repeat-retrotransposon (LTR-RT) families comprising 32 370 elements in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Approximately 87\% of these elements were located in recombinationsuppressed pericentromeric regions, where the ratio (1.26) of solo LTRs to intact elements (S/I) is significantly lower than that of chromosome arms (1.62). Further analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between S/I and LTR sizes, indicating that larger LTRs facilitate solo LTR formation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed seven Copia and five Gypsy evolutionary lineages that were present before the divergence of eudicot and monocot species, but the scales and timeframes within which they proliferated vary dramatically across families, lineages and species, and notably, a Copia lineage has been lost in soybean. Analysis of the physical association of LTR-RTs with centromere satellite repeats identified two putative centromere retrotransposon (CR) families of soybean, which were grouped into the CR (e.g. CRR and CRM) lineage found in grasses, indicating that the `functional specification' of CR pre-dates the bifurcation of eudicots and monocots. However, a number of families of the CR lineage are not concentrated in centromeres, suggesting that their CR roles may now be defunct. Our data also suggest that the envelope-like genes in the putative Copia retroviruslike family are probably derived from the Gypsy retrovirus-like lineage, and thus we propose the hypothesis of a single ancient origin of envelope-like genes in flowering plants.},

Proper analysis of this massive resource is expected to give novel insights into the structure, function, and evolution of the rice genome, and to aid the development of rice varieties through marker assisted selection or genomic selection. In this work we present sequencing and bioinformatics analyses of 104 rice varieties belonging to the major subspecies of Oryza sativa. We identified repetitive elements and recurrent copy number variation covering about 200 Mbp of the rice genome. Genotyping of over 18 million polymorphic locations within O. sativa allowed us to reconstruct the individual haplotype patterns shaping the genomic background of elite varieties used by farmers throughout the Americas. Based on a reconstruction of the alleles for the gene GBSSI, we could identify novel genetic markers for selection of varieties with high amylose content. We expect that both the analysis methods and the genomic information described here would be of great use for the rice research community and for other groups carrying on similar sequencing efforts in other crops.},

Despite the significance of this observation for evolutionary biology and genetics, the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to these interspecific differences are unclear. On fine physical scales, recombination rates appear to evolve rapidly between closely related species, but the mode and tempo of recombination rate evolution on the broader scale is poorly understood. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to begin to characterize the evolutionary processes underlying average genomic recombination rates in mammals. We document a strong phylogenetic effect in recombination rates, indicating that more closely related species tend to have more similar average rates of recombination. We demonstrate that this phylogenetic signal is not an artifact of errors in recombination rate estimation and show that it is robust to uncertainty in the mammalian phylogeny. Neutral evolutionary models present good fits to the data and we find no evidence for heterogeneity in the rate of evolution in recombination across the mammalian tree. These results suggest that observed interspecific variation in average genomic rates of recombination is largely attributable to the steady accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time. Although single recombination hotspots may live and die on short evolutionary time scales, the strong phylogenetic signal in genomic recombination rates indicates that the pace of evolution on this scale may be considerably slower.},

We measured recombination rates in eight species that collectively represent several temporal scales of divergence within a single rodent family, Muridae. We used a cytological approach that enables in situ visualization of crossovers at meiosis to quantify recombination rates in multiple males from each rodent group. We uncovered large differences in genomic recombination rate between rodent species, which were independent of karyotypic variation. The divergence in genomic recombination rate that we document is not proportional to DNA sequence divergence, suggesting that recombination has evolved at variable rates along the murid phylogeny. Additionally, we document significant variation in genomic recombination rate both within and between subspecies of house mice. Recombination rates estimated in F1 hybrids reveal evidence for sex-linked loci contributing to the evolution of recombination in house mice. Our results provide one of the first detailed portraits of genomic-scale recombination rate variation within a single mammalian family and demonstrate that the low recombination rates in laboratory mice and rats reflect a more general reduction in recombination rate across murid rodents.},

In many species, crossover number is subject to sexual dimorphism, and a lower crossover number is associated with shorter chromosome axes lengths. How this patterning is imposed remains poorly understood. Here, we show that overexpression of the Arabidopsis pro-crossover protein HEI10 increases crossovers but maintains some interference and sexual dimorphism. Disrupting the synaptonemal complex by mutating               ZYP1               also leads to an increase in crossovers but, in contrast, abolishes interference and disrupts the link between chromosome axis length and crossovers. Crucially, combining HEI10 overexpression and               zyp1               mutation leads to a massive and unprecedented increase in crossovers. These observations support and can be predicted by, a recently proposed model in which HEI10 diffusion along the synaptonemal complex drives a coarsening process leading to well-spaced crossover-promoting foci, providing a mechanism for crossover patterning.},

Recombination events, however, are also accompanied by short-scale, unidirectional exchanges known as gene conversion in the neighborhood of the initiating double-strand break. A large body of evidence suggests that gene conversion is GC-biased in many eukaryotes, including mammals and human. AT/GC heterozygotes produce more GC- than AT-gametes, thus conferring a population advantage to GC-alleles in high-recombining regions. This apparently unimportant feature of our molecular machinery has major evolutionary consequences. Structurally, GC-biased gene conversion explains the spatial distribution of GC-content in mammalian genomes{\textemdash}the so-called isochore structure. Functionally, GC-biased gene conversion promotes the segregation and fixation of deleterious AT {\textrightarrow} GC mutations, thus increasing our genomic mutation load. Here we review the recent evidence for a GC-biased gene conversion process in mammals, and its consequences for genomic landscapes, molecular evolution, and human functional genomics.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GCcontent (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

The density of transposons (DNA-based elements) along the chromosomes was found to be positively correlated with recombination rate, but this relationship was not observed for LTR or non-LTR retrotransposons (RNA-based elements). Gene (coding region) density is higher in regions of low recombination rate. However, the lower TE density in these regions is not due to the counterselection of TE insertions within exons since the same positive correlation between TE density and recombination rate was found in noncoding regions (both in introns and intergenic DNA). These data are not compatible with a global model of selection acting against TE insertions, for which an accumulation of elements in regions of reduced recombination is expected. We also found no evidence for a stronger selection against TE insertions on the X chromosome compared to the autosomes. The difference in distribution of the DNA and RNA-based elements along the chromosomes in relation to recombination rate can be explained by differences in the transposition processes.},

  abstract = {The rate at which recombination events occur in a population is an indicator of its effective population size and the organism's reproduction mode. It determines the extent of linkage disequilibrium along the genome and, thereby, the efficacy of both purifying and positive selection. The population recombination rate can be inferred using models of genome evolution in populations. Classical methods based on the patterns of linkage-disequilibrium provide the most accurate estimates, providing large sample sizes are used and the demography of the population is properly accounted for. Here, the capacity of approaches based on the sequentially Markov coalescent (SMC) to infer the genome-average recombination rate from as little as a single diploid genome is examined. SMC approaches provide highly accurate estimates even in the presence of changing population sizes, providing that (1) within genome heterogeneity is accounted for and (2) classical maximum-likelihood optimization algorithms are employed to fit the model. SMC-based estimates proved sensitive to the presence of gene conversion, which leads to an overestimation of the recombination rate if conversion events are frequent. Conversely, methods based on the correlation of heterozygosity succeed in disentangling the rate of crossing over from that of gene conversion events, but only when the population size is constant and the recombination landscape homogeneous. These results call for a convergence of these two methods to obtain accurate and comparable estimates of recombination rates between populations.},

In the genomic era, however, coalescent models are limited due to the complexity of the underlying ancestral recombination graph. The sequentially Markov coalescent (SMC) is a heuristic that enables the modelling of complete genomes under the coalescent framework. While it empowers the inference of detailed demographic history of a population from as few as one diploid genome, current implementations of the SMC make unrealistic assumptions about the homogeneity of the coalescent process along the genome, ignoring the intrinsic spatial variability of parameters such as the recombination rate. Here, I review the historical developments of SMC models and discuss the evidence for parameter heterogeneity. I then survey approaches to handle this heterogeneity, focusing on a recently developed extension of the SMC.},

We investigated whether there are specific changes in heterochromatin associated with interspecific hybridizations and found a strong reduction of chromatin condensation in the endosperm, connected with a strong loss of CHG and CHH methylation and random loss of a single chromosome. Consistent with reduced DNA methylation in the hybrid endosperm, we found a disproportionate deregulation of genes located close to pericentromeric regions, suggesting that reduced DNA methylation allows access of transcription factors to targets located in heterochromatic regions. Since the identified QTL were also associated with pericentromeric regions, we propose that relaxation of heterochromatin in response to interspecies hybridization exposes and activates loci leading to hybrid seed failure.},

  abstract = {Background: Although several genetic linkage maps of the chicken genome have been published, the resolution of these maps is limited and does not allow the precise identification of recombination hotspots. The availability of more than 3.2 million SNPs in the chicken genome and the recent advances in high throughput genotyping techniques enabled us to increase marker density for the construction of a high-resolution linkage map of the chicken genome. This high-resolution linkage map allowed us to study recombination hotspots across the genome between two chicken populations: a purebred broiler line and a broiler {\texttimes} broiler cross. In total, 1,619 animals from the two different broiler populations were genotyped with 17,790 SNPs. Results: The resulting linkage map comprises 13,340 SNPs. Although 360 polymorphic SNPs that had not been assigned to a known chromosome on chicken genome build WASHUC2 were included in this study, no new linkage groups were found. The resulting linkage map is composed of 31 linkage groups, with a total length of 3,054 cM for the sex-average map of the combined population. The sex-average linkage map of the purebred broiler line is 686 cM smaller than the linkage map of the broiler {\texttimes} broiler cross. Conclusions: In this study, we present a linkage map of the chicken genome at a substantially higher resolution than previously published linkage maps. Regional differences in recombination hotspots between the two mapping populations were observed in several chromosomes near the telomere of the p arm; the sex-specific analysis revealed that these regional differences were mainly caused by female-specific recombination hotspots in the broiler {\texttimes} broiler cross.},

Using F2 individuals, it is not possible in all cases to derive the gametes, which have fused, and which provide the information about interference unequivocally when three or more segregating markers are considered simultaneously. Therefore, a method was developed to estimate the gametic frequencies using a maximum likelihood approach together with the expectation maximisation algorithm. This estimation procedure was applied to F2 mapping data from rice (Oryza sativa L.) to carry out a genome-wide analysis of crossover interference. The distribution of the coefficient of coincidence in dependence on the recombination fraction revealed for all chromosomes increasing positive interference with decreasing interval size. For some chromosomes this mutual inhibition of recombination was not so strong in small intervals. The centromere had a significant effect on interference. The positive interference found in the chromosome arms were reduced significantly when the intervals considered spanned the centromere. Two chromosomes even demonstrated independent recombination and slightly negative interference for small intervals including the centromere. Different marker densities had no effect on the results. In general, interference depended on the frequency of recombination events in relation to the physical length. The strength of the centromere effect on interference seemed to depend on the strength of recombination suppression around the centromere.},

  abstract = {Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is one of the most conserved genes in eukaryotes. The multiples copies of rDNA in the genome evolve in a concerted manner, through unequal crossing over and/or gene conversion, two mechanisms related to homologous recombination. Recombination increases local GC content in several organisms through a process known as GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). gBGC has been well characterized in mammals, birds, and grasses, but its phylogenetic distribution across the tree of life is poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that recombination affects the evolution of base composition in 18S rDNA and examine the reliability of this thoroughly studied molecule as a marker of gBGC in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses of 18S rDNA in vertebrates and angiosperms reveal significant heterogeneity in the evolution of base composition across both groups. Mammals, birds, and grasses experience increases in the GC content of the 18S rDNA, consistent with previous genome-wide analyses. In addition, we observe increased GC contents in Ostariophysi ray-finned fishes and commelinid monocots (i.e., the clade including grasses), suggesting that the genomes of these two groups have been affected by gBGC. Polymorphism analyses in rDNA confirm that gBGC, not mutation bias, is the most plausible explanation for these patterns. We also find that helix and loop sites of the secondary structure of ribosomal RNA do not evolve at the same pace: loops evolve faster than helices, whereas helices are GC richer than loops. We extend analyses to major lineages of eukaryotes and suggest that gBGC might have also affected base composition in Giardia (Diplomonadina), nudibranch gastropods (Mollusca), and Asterozoa (Echinodermata).},

IRILs are powerful for high-resolution genetic mapping because they have undergone more recombination than usual Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). However, there is no mapping software able to generate actual centiMorgan distances from the segregation data obtained with IRILs. IRILmap software converts genetic distances computed with any linkage mapping program designed for RILs, so that IRILderived data can be used to get actual centiMorgan distances, directly comparable to F2, backcross or RIL-derived maps.},

  abstract = {Crossover interference in meiosis is often modeled via stationary renewal processes. Here we consider a new model to incorporate the known biological feature of ``obligate chiasma'' whereby in most organisms each bivalent almost always has at least one crossover. The initial crossover is modeled as uniformly distributed along the chromosome, and starting from its position, subsequent crossovers are placed with forward and backward stationary renewal processes using a chi-square distribution of intercrossover distances. We used our model as well as the standard chi-square model to simulate the patterns of crossover densities along bivalents or chromatids for those having zero, one, two, or three or more crossovers; indeed, such patterns depend on the number of crossovers. With both models, simulated patterns compare very well to those found experimentally in mice, both for MLH1 foci on bivalents and for crossovers on genetic maps. However, our model provides a better fit to experimental data as compared to the standard chi-square model, particularly regarding the distribution of numbers of crossovers per chromosome. Finally, our model predicts an enhancement of the recombination rate near the extremities, which, however, explains only a part of the pattern observed in mouse.},

  abstract = {Genetic recombination characterized by reciprocal exchange of genes on paired homologous chromosomes is the most prominent event in meiosis of almost all sexually reproductive organisms. It contributes to genome stability by ensuring the balanced segregation of paired homologs in meiosis, and it is also the major driving factor in generating genetic variation for natural and artificial selection. Meiotic recombination is subjected to the control of a highly stringent and complex regulating process and meiotic recombination frequency (MRF) may be affected by biological and abiotic factors such as sex, gene density, nucleotide content, and chemical/temperature treatments, having motivated tremendous researches for artificially manipulating MRF. Whether genome polyploidization would lead to a significant change in MRF has attracted both historical and recent research interests; however, tackling this fundamental question is methodologically challenging due to the lack of appropriate methods for tetrasomic genetic analysis, thus has led to controversial conclusions in the literature. This article presents a comprehensive and rigorous survey of genome duplication-mediated change in MRF using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a eukaryotic model. It demonstrates that genome duplication can lead to consistently significant increase in MRF and rate of crossovers across all 16 chromosomes of S. cerevisiae, including both cold and hot spots of MRF. This ploidy-driven change in MRF is associated with weakened recombination interference, enhanced double-strand break density, and loosened chromatin histone occupation. The study illuminates a significant evolutionary feature of genome duplication and opens an opportunity to accelerate response to artificial and natural selection through polyploidization.},

Using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology, a high-density genetic map was constructed with a population of 134 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) deriving from a cross between Golden Promise (GP) and H602, which contained 12,635 SLAFs with 26,693 SNPs, and spanned 896.74 cM with an average interval of 0.07 cM on seven chromosomes. Based on the map, a total of 16 QTLs for grain length (GL), grain width and thousand-grain weight were detected on 1H, 2H, 4H, 5H, and 6H. Among them, a major QTL locus qGL1, accounting for the max phenotypic variance of 16.7\% was located on 1H, which is a new unreported QTL affecting GL. In addition, the other two QTLs, qGL5 and qTGW5, accounting for the max phenotypic variances of 20.7 and 21.1\%, respectively, were identified in the same region, and sequencing results showed they are identical to HvDep1 gene. These results indicate that it is a feasible approach to construct a high-quality genetic map for QTL mapping by using SLAF markers, and the detected major QTLs qGL1, qGL5, and qTGW5 are useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of grain size in barley breeding.},

A dense genetic map associating genome sequences is highly desirable for reconstructing the chromosome pseudomolecules using the obtained sequence scaffold assemblies. For this purpose, an intraspecific full-sib F1 mapping pedigree was established by using the sequenced P. deltoides as the maternal parent. With this mapping pedigree, we constructed a high-density genetic map using 92 randomly selected progenies. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were discovered by using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). In total, 487,038 SLAFs were generated, of which 179,360 were polymorphic. A high-density genetic map was built using HighMap software, which included 11,680 Mendelian segregation markers distributing in 2851 marker bins. The established map consisted of 19 linkage groups (LGs) that equaled to the 19 haploid chromosomes in poplar genome, and spanned a total genetic length of 3494.66 cM, with an average distance of 1.23 cM per marker bin. The map presented here will be useful for anchoring the genome sequence assemblies along chromosomes, and for many other aspects of genetic studies on P. deltoides and the closely related species.},

However, limited genomic information has hindered the application of molecular tools towards understanding genome evolution and in breeding new cultivars. We genotype a first-generation selfed population derived from the tetraploid (4x\,=\,36) `A12359' using genotyping-by-sequencing. A high-density genetic map of 18 linkage groups (LGs) is constructed with 3,544 markers. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that each of nine homeologous LG pairs of               C. dactylon               corresponds to one of the first nine chromosomes of               Oropetium thomaeum               . Two nested paleo-ancestor chromosome fusions ({$\rho$}6-{$\rho$}9-{$\rho$}6, {$\rho$}2-{$\rho$}10-{$\rho$}2) may have resulted in a 12-to-10 chromosome reduction. A segmental dissemination of the paleo-chromosome {$\rho$}12 ({$\rho$}1-{$\rho$}12-{$\rho$}1, {$\rho$}6-{$\rho$}12-{$\rho$}6) leads to the 10-to-9 chromosome reduction in               C. dactylon               genome. The genetic map will assist in an ongoing whole genome sequence assembly and facilitate marker-assisted selection (MAS) in developing new cultivars.},

  abstract = {Background: Gossypium barbadense (Sea Island, Egyptian or Pima cotton) cotton has high fiber quality, however, few studies have investigated the genetic basis of its traits using molecular markers. Genome complexity reduction approaches such as genotyping-by-sequencing have been utilized to develop abundant markers for the construction of high-density genetic maps to locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Results: The Chinese G. barbadense cultivar 5917 and American Pima S-7 were used to develop a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population with 143 lines. The 143 RILs together with their parents were tested in three replicated field tests for lint yield traits (boll weight and lint percentage) and fiber quality traits (fiber length, fiber elongation, fiber strength, fiber uniformity and micronaire) and then genotyped using GBS to develop single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A high-density genetic map with 26 linkage groups (LGs) was constructed using 3557 GBS SNPs spanning a total genetic distance of 3076.23 cM at an average density of 1.09 cM between adjacent markers. A total of 42 QTLs were identified, including 24 QTLs on 12 LGs for fiber quality and 18 QTLs on 7 LGs for lint yield traits, with LG1 (9 QTLs), LG10 (7 QTLs) and LG14 (6 QTLs) carrying more QTLs. Common QTLs for the same traits and overlapping QTLs for different traits were detected. Each individual QTLs explained 0.97 to 20.7\% of the phenotypic variation. Conclusions: This study represents one of the first genetic mapping studies on the fiber quality and lint yield traits in a RIL population of G. barbadense using GBS-SNPs. The results provide important information for the subsequent fine mapping of QTLs and the prediction of candidate genes towards map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection in cotton.},

Breeding barley cultivars with high GPC has practical value for feed and food properties. The aim of the present study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for GPC that could be detected under multiple environments. Results: A population of 190 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) deriving from a cross between Chinese landrace ZGMLEL with high GPC ({$>$} 20\%) and Australian cultivar Schooner was used for linkage and QTL analyses. The genetic linkage map spanned 2353.48 cM in length with an average locus interval of 2.33 cM. GPC was evaluated under six environments for the RIL population and the two parental lines. In total, six environmentally stable QTLs for GPC were detected on chromosomes 2H (1), 4H (1), 6H (1), and 7H (3) and the increasing alleles were derived from ZGMLEL. Notably, the three QTLs on chromosome 7H (QGpc.ZiSc-7H.1, QGpc.ZiSc-7H.2, and QGpc.ZiSc-7H.3) that linked in coupling phase were firstly identified. Moreover, the genetic effects of stable QTLs on chromosomes 2H, 6H and 7H were validated using near isogenic lines (NILs). Conclusions: Collectively, the identified QTLs expanded our knowledge about the genetic basis of GPC in barley and could be selected to develop cultivars with high grain protein concentration.},

  abstract = {The detection of molecular signatures of selection is one of the major concerns of modern population genetics. A widely used strategy in this context is to compare samples from several populations and to look for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic differentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between populations, which are measured by FST or related statistics. Here we introduce a new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of haplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing statistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled populations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two features{\textemdash}the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure of populations{\textemdash}significantly improves the detection power of selected loci and that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We also show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and improves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK to a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe and identify seven regions under selection, which include already reported regions but also several new ones. We propose a method to help identifying the population(s) under selection in a detected region, which reveals that in many of these regions selection most likely occurred in more than one population. Furthermore, several of the detected regions correspond to incomplete sweeps, where the favorable haplotype is only at intermediate frequency in the population(s) under selection.},

  abstract = {Species abundance distributions are widely used in explaining natural communities, their natural evolution and the impacts of environmental disturbance. A commonly used approach is that of rank-abundance distributions. Favored, biologically founded models are the geometric series (GS) and the broken stick (BS) model. Comparing observed abundance distributions with those predicted by models is an extremely timeconsuming task. Also, using goodness-of-fit tests for frequency distributions (like Chi-square or Kolmogorov{\textendash}Smirnov tests) to compare observed with expected frequencies is problematic because the best way to calculate expected frequencies may be controversial. More important, the Chi-square test may prove if an observed distribution statistically differs from a model, but does not allow the investigator to choose among competing models from which the observed distribution does not differ. Both models can be easily tested by regression analysis. In GS, if a log scale is used for abundance, the species exactly fall along a straight line. The BS distribution shows up as nearly linear when a log scale is used for the rank axis. Regression analysis is proposed here as a simpler and more efficient method to fit the GS and BS models. Also, regression analysis (1) does not suffer from assumptions related to Chi-square tests; (2) obviates the need to establish expected frequencies, and (3) offers the possibility to choose the best fit among competing models. A possible extension of abundance-rank analysis to species richness on islands is also proposed as a method to discriminate between relict and equilibrial models. Examples of application to field data are also presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Nature has found many ways to utilize transposable elements (TEs) throughout evolution. Many molecular and cellular processes depend on DNA-binding proteins recognizing hundreds or thousands of similar DNA motifs dispersed throughout the genome that are often provided by TEs. It has been suggested that TEs play an important role in the evolution of such systems, in particular, the rewiring of gene regulatory networks. One mechanism that can further enhance the rewiring of regulatory networks is nonallelic gene conversion between copies of TEs. Here, we will first review evidence for nonallelic gene conversion in TEs. Then, we will illustrate the benefits nonallelic gene conversion provides in rewiring regulatory networks. For instance, nonallelic gene conversion between TE copies offers an alternative mechanism to spread beneficial mutations that improve the network, it allows multiple mutations to be combined and transferred together, and it allows natural selection to work efficiently in spreading beneficial mutations and removing disadvantageous mutations. Future studies examining the role of nonallelic gene conversion in the evolution of TEs should help us to better understand how TEs have contributed to evolution.},

  abstract = {There is currently great interest in understanding the way in which recombination rates vary, over short scales, across the human genome. Aside from inherent interest, an understanding of this local variation is essential for the sensible design and analysis of many studies aimed at elucidating the genetic basis of common diseases or of human population histories. Standard pedigree-based approaches do not have the fine scale resolution that is needed to address this issue. In contrast, samples of deoxyribonucleic acid sequences from unrelated chromosomes in the population carry relevant information, but inference from such data is extremely challenging. Although there has been much recent interest in the development of full likelihood inference methods for estimating local recombination rates from such data, they are not currently practicable for data sets of the size being generated by modern experimental techniques. We introduce and study two approximate likelihood methods. The first, a marginal likelihood, ignores some of the data. A careful choice of what to ignore results in substantial computational savings with virtually no loss of relevant information. For larger sequences, we introduce a `composite' likelihood, which approximates the model of interest by ignoring certain long-range dependences. An informal asymptotic analysis and a simulation study suggest that inference based on the composite likelihood is practicable and performs well. We combine both methods to reanalyse data from the lipoprotein lipase gene, and the results seriously question conclusions from some earlier studies of these data.},

  abstract = {The wheat group has evolved through allopolyploidization, namely, through hybridization among species from the plant genera Aegilops and Triticum followed by genome doubling. This speciation process has been associated with ecogeographical expansion and with domestication. In the past few decades, we have searched for explanations for this impressive success. Our studies attempted to probe the bases for the wide genetic variation characterizing these species, which accounts for their great adaptability and colonizing ability. Central to our work was the investigation of how allopolyploidization alters genome structure and expression. We found in wheat that allopolyploidy accelerated genome evolution in two ways: (1) it triggered rapid genome alterations through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic changes (which we termed ``revolutionary'' changes), and (2) it facilitated sporadic genomic changes throughout the species' evolution (i.e., evolutionary changes), which are not attainable at the diploid level. Our major findings in natural and synthetic allopolyploid wheat indicate that these alterations have led to the cytological and genetic diploidization of the allopolyploids. These genetic and epigenetic changes reflect the dynamic structural and functional plasticity of the allopolyploid wheat genome. The significance of this plasticity for the successful establishment of wheat allopolyploids, in nature and under domestication, is discussed.},

We found that patterns of methylation are very similar in flowering plants with methylated cytosines detected in all sequence contexts, whereas CG methylation predominates in animals. Vertebrates have methylation throughout the genome except for CpG islands. Gene body methylation is conserved with clear preference for exons in most organisms. Furthermore, genes appear to be the major target of methylation in Ciona and honey bee. Among the eight organisms, the green alga Chlamydomonas has the most unusual pattern of methylation, having non-CG methylation enriched in exons of genes rather than in repeats and transposons. In addition, the Dnmt1 cofactor Uhrf1 has a conserved function in maintaining CG methylation in both transposons and gene bodies in the mouse, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish genomes.},

Recombination frequency is well correlated with gene density for each chromosome (r = 0.767{\textendash}0.960), although in centromeric regions, recombination is more depressed than a strict correlation with gene density would indicate. In addition, the distribution of major retrotransposon classes and of Mu and Helitron insertion sites were examined. Overall retrotransposon density is equal at all maize chromosomes (r = 0.996), although different classes of retrotransposons display preferential insertion into different chromosome regions. Cinful, Zeon, and Prem are more common near the centromere, while Opie, Ji, and Huck preferentially reside at the subtelomeric segments of chromosomes. Grande does not show preference in distribution relative to physical location on the chromosome. Comparison of the distribution of genic overgo probe hybridization-positive BACs from maize inbred line B73 to those of the inbred Mo17 indicates that nonshared genic segments, many of which correspond to pseudogenes carried by the Helitron elements, tend to be less common in the centromeric region. As previously reported, Mu transposons seem to preferentially insert in the vicinity of genes, as indicated by their paucity in centromeric regions, and moderate correlation (r = 0.759) with gene density.},

However, crossover events are relatively rare, typically one to three exchange points per chromosome pair. Recent work has identified three pathways limiting meiotic crossovers in               Arabidopsis thaliana               that rely on the activity of FANCM [Crismani W, et al. (2012)               Science               336:1588{\textendash}1590], RECQ4 [S{\'e}gu{\'e}la-Arnaud M, et al. (2015)               Proc Natl Acad Sci USA               112:4713{\textendash}4718], and FIGL1 [Girard C, et al. (2015)               PLoS Genet               11:e1005369]. Here we analyzed recombination in plants in which one, two, or all three of these pathways were disrupted in both pure line and hybrid contexts. The greatest effect was observed when combining               recq4               and               figl1               mutations, which increased the hybrid genetic map length from 389 to 3,037 cM. This corresponds to an unprecedented 7.8-fold increase in crossover frequency. Disrupting the three pathways did not further increase recombination, suggesting that some upper limit had been reached. The increase in crossovers is not uniform along chromosomes and rises from centromere to telomere. Finally, although in wild type recombination is much higher in male meiosis than in female meiosis (490 cM vs. 290 cM), female recombination is higher than male recombination in               recq4 figl1               (3,200 cM vs. 2,720 cM), suggesting that the factors that make wild-type female meiosis less recombinogenic than male wild-type meiosis do not apply in the mutant context. The massive increase in recombination observed in               recq4 figl1               hybrids opens the possibility of manipulating recombination to enhance plant breeding efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Crossing over, in addition to its strictly genetic role, also performs a critical mechanical function, by bonding homologues in meiosis. Hence, it is responsible for an orderly reduction of the chromosome number. As such, it is strictly controlled in frequency and distribution. The well-known crossover control is positive crossover interference which reduces the probability of a crossover in the vicinity of an already formed crossover. A poorly studied aspect of the control is chromatid interference. Such analyses are possible in very few organisms as they require observation of all four products of a single meiosis. Here, we provide direct evidence of chromatid interference. Using in situ probing in two interspecific plant hybrids (Lolium multiflorum{\texttimes}Festuca pratensis and Allium cepa{\texttimes}A. roylei) during anaphase I, we demonstrate that the involvement of four chromatids in double crossovers is significantly more frequent than expected (64\% versus 25\%). We also provide a physical measure of the crossover interference distance, covering {\textasciitilde}30{\textendash}40\% of the relative chromosome arm length, and show that the centromere acts as a barrier for crossover interference. The two arms of a chromosome appear to act as independent units in the process of crossing over. Chromatid interference has to be seriously addressed in genetic mapping approaches and further studies.},

Theory has tended to focus on genetic relatedness, but ecology can be just as important a determinant of whether eusociality evolves. Using the model of Fu et al. (2015), we show how ecological assumptions critically affect the conclusions drawn. Fu et al. inferred that eusociality rarely evolves because it faces a fundamental `risk-return tradeoff'. The intuitive logic was that worker production represents an opportunity cost because it delays realising a reproductive payoff. However, making empirically justified assumptions that (1) workers take over egg-laying following queen death and (2) productivity increases gradually with each additional worker, we find that the risk-return tradeoff disappears. We then survey Hymenoptera with more specialised morphological castes, and show how the interaction between two common features of eusociality {\textendash} saturating birth rates and group size-dependent helping decisions {\textendash} can determine whether eusociality outperforms other strategies.},

We describe the de novo assembly and ab initio annotation of the genome of a doubled haploid onion line DHCU066619, which resulted in a final assembly of 14.9\,Gb with an N50 of 464 Kb. Of this, 2.4\,Gb was ordered into eight pseudomolecules using four genetic linkage maps. The remainder of the genome is available in 89.6\,K scaffolds. Only 72.4\% of the genome could be identified as repetitive sequences and consist, to a large extent, of (retro) transposons. In addition, an estimated 20\% of the putative (retro) transposons had accumulated a large number of mutations, hampering their identification, but facilitating their assembly. These elements are probably already quite old. The ab initio gene prediction indicated 540,925 putative gene models, which is far more than expected, possibly due to the presence of pseudogenes. Of these models, 47,066 showed RNASeq support. No gene rich regions were found, genes are uniformly distributed over the genome. Analysis of synteny with Allium sativum (garlic) showed collinearity but also major rearrangements between both species. This assembly is the first high-quality genome sequence available for the study of onion and will be a valuable resource for further research.},

We demonstrate the method using both simulated data (calibrated from experiments on Drosophila melanogaster) and real data from five distinct crosses within the flowering plant genus Mimulus. Application of GOOGA to the Mimulus data corrects numerous errors (misplaced sequences) in the M. guttatus reference genome and confirms or detects eight large inversions polymorphic within the species complex.

To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on human recombination, we examined crossover patterns in transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring, using dense genotyping data collected in a large set of pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring in proportion to physical length. The requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its correct segregation. We also found a set of double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover interference. These findings point to multiple mechanisms that shape the distribution of crossovers, influencing proper disjunction in humans.},

  abstract = {For many organisms, meiotic double crossing over is less frequent than expected on theassumption that exchanges occur at random with respect to each other. This ``interference,''which can be almost total for nearby intervals, diminishes as the intervals in which the double crossovers are scored are moved farther apart.Most models for interferencehave assumed, at least implicitly,that the intensity of interference depends inversely on the physical distance separating the intervals. However, several observations suggest that interference depends on genetic distance (Morgans) rather than physical distance (base pairs or micrometers). Accordingly, we devise a model in which interference is related directly to genetic distance. Its central feature is that recombinational intermediates (C's) have two fates-they can be resolved with crossinogver (Cx)or without (Co).We suppose that C's are distributed at random with respect to each other (no interference); interference results from constraints on the resolution of C's. The basic constraint is that each pair of neighboring Cx's must havebetween them a certain number ofCo's. The requirednumber of intervening Co's fora given organism or chromosome is estimated from the fraction of gene conversions that are unaccompanied by crossover of flanking markers. The predictions of the model are compared with data from Drosophila and Neurospora.},

  abstract = {Fission yeast Rec12 (Spo11 homolog) initiates meiotic recombination by forming developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB distributions influence patterns of heredity and genome evolution, but the basis of the highly nonrandom choice of Rec12 cleavage sites is poorly understood, largely because available maps are of relatively low resolution and sensitivity. Here, we determined DSBs genome-wide at near-nucleotide resolution by sequencing the oligonucleotides attached to Rec12 following DNA cleavage. The single oligonucleotide size class allowed us to deeply sample all break events. We find strong evidence across the genome for differential DSB repair accounting for crossover invariance (constant cM/kb in spite of DSB hotspots). Surprisingly, about half of all crossovers occur in regions where DSBs occur at low frequency and are widely dispersed in location from cell to cell. These previously undetected, low-level DSBs thus play an outsized and crucial role in meiosis. We further find that the influence of underlying nucleotide sequence and chromosomal architecture differs in multiple ways from that in budding yeast. DSBs are not strongly restricted to nucleosome-depleted regions, as they are in budding yeast, but are nevertheless spatially influenced by chromatin structure. Our analyses demonstrate that evolutionarily fluid factors contribute to crossover initiation and regulation.},

  abstract = {Viable gamete formation requires segregation of homologous chromosomes connected, in most species, by cross-overs. DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and the resulting cross-overs are regulated at multiple levels to prevent overabundance along chromosomes. Meiotic cells coordinate these events between distant sites, but the physical basis of long-distance chromosomal communication has been unknown. We show that DSB hotspots up to {$\sim$}200 kb ({$\sim$}35 cM) apart form clusters via hotspot-binding proteins Rec25 and Rec27 in fission yeast. Clustering coincides with hotspot competition and interference over similar distances. Without Tel1 (an ATM tumor-suppressor homolog), DSB and crossover interference become negative, reflecting coordinated action along a chromosome. These results indicate that DSB hotspots within a limited chromosomal region and bound by their protein determinants form a clustered structure that, via Tel1, allows only one DSB per region. Such a ``roulette'' process within clusters explains the observed pattern of crossover interference in fission yeast. Key structural and regulatory components of clusters are phylogenetically conserved, suggesting conservation of this vital regulation. Based on these observations, we propose a model and discuss variations in which clustering and competition between DSB sites leads to DSB interference and in turn produces crossover interference.},

We have generated null mutants of the duplicated               Arabidopsis               transverse filament genes               zyp1a               and               zyp1b               using a combination of T-DNA insertional mutants and targeted CRISPR/Cas mutagenesis. Cytological and genetic analysis of the               zyp1               null mutants reveals loss of the obligate chiasma, an increase in recombination map length by 1.3- to 1.7-fold and a virtual absence of cross-over (CO) interference, determined by a significant increase in the number of double COs. At diplotene, the numbers of HEI10 foci, a marker for Class I interference-sensitive COs, are twofold greater in the               zyp1               mutant compared to wild type. The increase in recombination in               zyp1               does not appear to be due to the Class II interference-insensitive COs as chiasmata were reduced by {$\sim$}52\% in               msh5/zyp1               compared to               msh5               .

  abstract = {The centromeres of two tomato chromosomes have been precisely localized on the molecular linkage map through dosage analysis of trisomic stocks. To map the centromeres of chromosomes 7 and 9, complementary telo-, secondary, and tertiary trisomic stocks were used to assign DNA markers to their respective chromosome arms and thus to localize the centromere at the junction of the short and long arms. It was found that both centromeres are situated within a cluster of cosegregating markers. In an attempt to order the markers within the centric clusters, genetic maps of the centromeric regions of chromosomes 7 and 9 were constructed from F2 populations of 1620 Lycopersicon esculentum x L. pennellii (E x P) plants and 1640 L. esculentumxL, pimpinellifolium (E x PM) plants. Despite the large number of plants analyzed, very few recombination events were detected in the centric regions, indicating a significant suppression of recombination at this region of the chromosome. The fact that recombination suppression is equally strong in crosses between closely related (E x PM) and remotely related (E x P) parents suggests that centromeric suppression is not due to DNA sequence mismatches but to some other mechanism. The greatest number of centromeric markers was resolved in the L. esculentum x L. pennellii F2 population. The centromere of chromosome 7 is surrounded by eight cosegregating markers: three on the short arm, five on the long arm. Similarly, the centric region of chromosome 9 contains ten cosegregating markers including one short arm marker and nine long arm markers. The localization of centromeres to precise intervals on the molecular linkage map represents the first step towards the characterization and ultimate isolation of tomato centromeres.},

Results               We use partial correlations to construct partially directed graphs for the following four variables: GC-content, recombination rate, exon density and distance-to-telomere. Recombination rate and exon density are unconditionally uncorrelated, but become inversely correlated by conditioning on GC-content. This pattern indicates a model where recombination rate and exon density are two independent causes of GC-content variation.

However, empirical evidence indicates that nascent hotspots are susceptible to removal due to biased gene conversion, so it is paradoxical that they should be so widespread. Previous modeling work has shown that hotspots can evolve due to genetic drift overpowering their intrinsic disadvantage. Here we synthesize recent theoretical and empirical results to show how natural selection can favor hotspots. We propose that hotspots are part of a cycle of antagonistic coevolution between two tightly linked chromosomal regions: an inducer region that initiates recombination during meiosis by cutting within a nearby region of DNA and the cut region itself, which can evolve to be resistant to cutting. Antagonistic coevolution between inducers and their cut sites is driven by recurrent episodes of Hill{\textendash}Robertson interference, genetic hitchhiking, and biased gene conversion.},

The genetic variation underlying quantitative traits results from the segregation of numerous interacting quantitative trait loci (QTLs), whose expression is modified by the environment. To uncover the molecular basis of this variation, we characterized a QTL (               Brix9               -               2               -               5               ) derived from the green-fruited tomato species               Lycopersicon pennellii               . The wild-species allele increased glucose and fructose contents in cultivated tomato fruits in various genetic backgrounds and environments. Using nearly isogenic lines for the QTL, high-resolution mapping analysis delimited               Brix9               -               2               -               5               to a single nucleotide polymorphism-defined recombination hotspot of 484 bp spanning an exon and intron of a fruit-specific apoplastic invertase.

In crop tomato, recombination is curtailed as manifested by linkage disequilibrium decay over a longer distance and reduced diversity compared to wild relatives. Here we compare domesticated and wild populations of tomato and find an overall conserved recombination landscape, with local changes in effective recombination rate in specific genomic regions. We also study the dynamics of recombination hotspots resulting from domestication and found that loss of such hotspots is associated with selective sweeps, most notably in the pericentromeric heterochromatin. We found footprints of genetic changes and structural variants, among them associated with transposable elements, linked with hotspot divergence during domestication, likely causing fine-scale alterations to recombination patterns and resulting in linkage drag.},

We here propose a simple reaction-diffusion model, where a ``randomly walking'' precursor becomes immobilized and matures into a crossover point. The interference is caused by pair-annihilation of the random walkers due to their collision and by annihilation of a random walker due to its collision with an immobilized point. This model has two parameters{\textemdash}the initial density of the random walkers and the rate of its processing into a crossover point. We show numerically that, as the former increases and/or the latter decreases, plotted curves of the coincidence vs. the genetic distance converge on a unique curve. Thus, our model explains the similarity between Drosophila and Neurospora without parameter values adjusted finely, although it is not a ``genetic model'' but is a ``physical model,'' specifying explicitly what happens physically.},

Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) enables generating efficient data for high-quality genetic map construction and QTL analysis in a relatively accessible way.

Results: We genotyped 162 offspring in the F1 `Spadona' x `Harrow Sweet' pear population using GBS. An additional 21 pear accessions, including the F1 population's parents, from our germplasm collection were subjected to GBS to examine diverse genetic backgrounds that are associated to agriculturally relevant traits and to enhance the power of SNP calling. A standard SNP calling pipeline identified 206,971 SNPs with Asian pear (`Suli') as the reference genome and 148,622 SNPs with the European genome (`Bartlett').

We aligned 1030 scaffolds covering a total size of 165.5 Mbp (29\%) of the European pear genome to the 17 linkage groups. For high-resolution QTL analysis covering the whole genome, we used phenotyping for vegetative budbreak time in the F1 population. New QTLs associated to vegetative budbreak time were detected on linkage groups 5, 13 and 15. A major QTL on linkage group 8 and an additional QTL on linkage group 9 were confirmed.

As part of The SNP Consortium Allele Frequency Projects, we characterized haplotype patterns across 51 autosomal regions (spanning 13 megabases of the human genome) in samples from Africa, Europe, and Asia. We show that the human genome can be parsed objectively into haplotype blocks: sizable regions over which there is little evidence for historical recombination and within which only a few common haplotypes are observed. The boundaries of blocks and specific haplotypes they contain are highly correlated across populations. We demonstrate that such haplotype frameworks provide substantial statistical power in association studies of common genetic variation across each region. Our results provide a foundation for the construction of a haplotype map of the human genome, facilitating comprehensive genetic association studies of human disease.},

  abstract = {Selection on codon usage bias is well documented in a number of microorganisms. Whether codon usage is also generally shaped by natural selection in large organisms, despite their relatively small effective population size (Ne), is unclear. In animals, the population genetics of codon usage bias has only been studied in a handful of model organisms so far, and can be affected by confounding, nonadaptive processes such as GC-biased gene conversion and experimental artefacts. Using population transcriptomics data, we analyzed the relationship between codon usage, gene expression, allele frequency distribution, and recombination rate in 30 nonmodel species of animals, each from a different family, covering a wide range of effective population sizes. We disentangled the effects of translational selection and GC-biased gene conversion on codon usage by separately analyzing GC-conservative and GC-changing mutations. We report evidence for effective translational selection on codon usage in large-Ne species of animals, but not in small-Ne ones, in agreement with the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. C- and T-ending codons tend to be preferred over synonymous G- and A-ending ones, for reasons that remain to be determined. In contrast, we uncovered a conspicuous effect of GC-biased gene conversion, which is widespread in animals and the main force determining the fate of AT\$GC mutations. Intriguingly, the strength of its effect was uncorrelated with Ne.},

  abstract = {GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a molecular evolutionary force that favours GC over AT alleles irrespective of their fitness effect. Quantifying the variation in time and across genomes of its intensity is key to properly interpret patterns of molecular evolution. In particular, the existing literature is unclear regarding the relationship between gBGC strength and species effective population size, Ne. Here we analysed the nucleotide substitution pattern in coding sequences of closely related species of mammals, thus accessing a high resolution map of the intensity of gBGC. Our maximum likelihood approach shows that gBGC is pervasive, highly variable among species and genes, and of strength positively correlated with Ne in mammals. We estimate that gBGC explains up to 60\% of the total amount of synonymous AT{\textrightarrow}GC substitutions. We show that the fine-scale analysis of gBGC-induced nucleotide substitutions has the potential to inform on various aspects of molecular evolution, such as the distribution of fitness effects of mutations and the dynamics of recombination hotspots.},

Third codon position GC content, however, is influenced by both neutral forces (e.g., mutation bias) and natural selection for codon usage optimization. In this article, large data sets of noncoding DNA sequence polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans were gathered from public databases to try to disentangle these two factors{\textemdash}noncoding sequences are not affected by selection for codon usage. Allele frequency analyses revealed an asymmetric pattern of AT vs. GC noncoding polymorphisms: AT {\textrightarrow} GC mutations are less numerous, and tend to segregate at a higher frequency, than GC {\textrightarrow} AT ones, especially at GC-rich loci. This is indicative of nonstationary evolution of base composition and/or of GC-biased allele transmission. Fitting population genetics models to the allele frequency spectra confirmed this result and favored the hypothesis of a biased transmission. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that GC-biased gene conversion has influenced base composition evolution in Drosophila and explain the correlation between intron and exon GC content.},

We report the establishment of a large maize SNP array and its use for diversity analysis and high density linkage mapping. The markers, taken from more than 800,000 SNPs, were selected to be preferentially located in genes and evenly distributed across the genome. The array was tested with a set of maize germplasm including North American and European inbred lines, parent/ F1 combinations, and distantly related teosinte material. A total of 49,585 markers, including 33,417 within 17,520 different genes and 16,168 outside genes, were of good quality for genotyping, with an average failure rate of 4\% and rates up to 8\% in specific germplasm. To demonstrate this array's use in genetic mapping and for the independent validation of the B73 sequence assembly, two intermated maize recombinant inbred line populations {\textendash} IBM (B736Mo17) and LHRF (F26F252) {\textendash}were genotyped to establish two high density linkage maps with 20,913 and 14,524 markers respectively. 172 mapped markers were absent in the current B73 assembly and their placement can be used for future improvements of the B73 reference sequence. Colinearity of the genetic and physical maps was mostly conserved with some exceptions that suggest errors in the B73 assembly. Five major regions containing non-colinearities were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, and are supported by both independent genetic maps. Four additional non-colinear regions were found on the LHRF map only; they may be due to a lower density of IBM markers in those regions or to true structural rearrangements between lines. Given the array's high quality, it will be a valuable resource for maize genetics and many aspects of maize breeding.},

A total of 49,585 markers, including 33,417 within 17,520 different genes and 16,168 outside genes, were of good quality for genotyping, with an average failure rate of 4\% and rates up to 8\% in specific germplasm. To demonstrate this array's use in genetic mapping and for the independent validation of the B73 sequence assembly, two intermated maize recombinant inbred line populations {\textendash} IBM (B736Mo17) and LHRF (F26F252) {\textendash}were genotyped to establish two high density linkage maps with 20,913 and 14,524 markers respectively. 172 mapped markers were absent in the current B73 assembly and their placement can be used for future improvements of the B73 reference sequence. Colinearity of the genetic and physical maps was mostly conserved with some exceptions that suggest errors in the B73 assembly. Five major regions containing non-colinearities were identified on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, and are supported by both independent genetic maps. Four additional non-colinear regions were found on the LHRF map only; they may be due to a lower density of IBM markers in those regions or to true structural rearrangements between lines. Given the array's high quality, it will be a valuable resource for maize genetics and many aspects of maize breeding.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Genetic recombination is a very important evolutionary mechanism that mixes parental haplotypes and produces new raw material for organismal evolution. As a result, information on recombination rates is critical for biological research. In this paper, we introduce a new extremely fast open-source software package (FastEPRR) that uses machine learning to estimate recombination rate {$\rho$} (=4Ner) from intraspecific DNA polymorphism data. When {$\rho\&$}gt;10 and the number of sampled diploid individuals is large enough ({$\geq$}50), the variance of {$\rho$}FastEPRR remains slightly smaller than that of {$\rho$}LDhat. The new estimate {$\rho$}comb (calculated by averaging {$\rho$}FastEPRR and {$\rho$}LDhat) has the smallest variance of all cases. When estimating {$\rho$}FastEPRR, the finite-site model was employed to analyze cases with a high rate of recurrent mutations, and an additional method is proposed to consider the effect of variable recombination rates within windows. Simulations encompassing a wide range of parameters demonstrate that different evolutionary factors, such as demography and selection, may not increase the false positive rate of recombination hotspots. Overall, accuracy of FastEPRR is similar to the well-known method, LDhat, but requires far less computation time. Genetic maps for each human population (YRI, CEU, and CHB) extracted from the 1000 Genomes OMNI data set were obtained in less than 3~d using just a single CPU core. The Pearson Pairwise correlation coefficient between the {$\rho$}FastEPRR and {$\rho$}LDhat maps is very high, ranging between 0.929 and 0.987 at a 5-Mb scale. Considering that sample sizes for these kinds of data are increasing dramatically with advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, FastEPRR (freely available at http://www.picb.ac.cn/evolgen/) is expected to become a widely used tool for establishing genetic maps and studying recombination hotspots in the population genomic era.},

We have constructed the first eight-parent MAGIC genetic map for wheat, comprising 18 601 SNP markers. We validated the accuracy of our map against the wheat genome sequence and found an improvement in accuracy compared to published genetic maps. Our map shows a notable increase in precision resulting from the three generations of intercrossing required to create the population. This is most pronounced in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes. Sixteen percent of mapped markers exhibited segregation distortion (SD) with many occurring in long ({$>$}20 cM) blocks. Some of the longest and most distorted blocks were collinear with noncentromeric high-marker-density regions of the genome, suggesting they were candidates for introgression fragments introduced into the bread wheat gene pool from other grass species. We investigated two of these linkage blocks in detail and found strong evidence that one on chromosome 4AL, showing SD against the founder Robigus, is an interspecific introgression fragment. The completed map is available from http://www.niab.com/pages/id/326/Resources.},

Two new chickpea Oligo Pool All (OPAs) each having 3,072 SNPs were designed and utilized for SNP genotyping of 129 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs). Using Illumina GoldenGate Technology genotyping data of 5,041 SNPs were generated and combined with the 1,673 marker data from previously published studies, to generate a high resolution linkage map. The map comprised of 6698 markers distributed on eight linkage groups spanning 1083.93\,cM with an average inter-marker distance of 0.16\,cM. Utility of the present map was demonstrated for improving the anchoring of the earlier reported draft genome sequence of desi chickpea by {\textasciitilde}30\% and that of kabuli chickpea by 18\%. The genetic map reported in this study represents the most dense linkage map of chickpea , with the potential to facilitate efficient anchoring of the draft genome sequences of desi as well as kabuli chickpea varieties.},

  abstract = {Background: During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange segments via the formation of crossovers. This phenomenon is highly regulated; in particular, crossovers are distributed heterogeneously along the physical map and rarely arise in close proximity, a property referred to as ``interference''. Crossover positions form patterns that give clues about how crossovers are formed. In several organisms including yeast, tomato, Arabidopsis, and mouse, it is believed that crossovers form via at least two pathways, one interfering, the other not. Results: We have developed a software package - ``CODA'', for CrossOver Distribution Analyzer - which allows one to quantitatively characterize crossover patterns by fitting interference models to experimental data. Two families of interfering models are provided: the ``gamma'' model and the ``beam-film'' model. The user can specify single or two-pathways modeling, and the software package infers the model's parameters and their confidence intervals. CODA can handle data produced from measurements on bivalents or gametes, in the form of continuous crossover positions or marker genotyping. We illustrate the possibilities on data from Wheat, corn and mouse. Conclusions: CODA extends the kind of crossover data that could be analyzed so far to include gametic data (rather than only bivalents/tetrads) when using two-pathways modeling. It will also enable users to perform analyses based on the beam-film model. CODA implements that model's complex physics and mathematics, and uses a summary statistic to overcomes the lack of a computable likelihood which has hampered its use till now.},

Characterizing the genetic diversity present in the extant germplasm pool of B. napus is fundamental to better conserve, manage and utilize the genetic resources of this species. We used sequence-based genotyping to identify and genotype 30,881 SNPs in a diversity panel of 782 B. napus accessions, representing samples of winter and spring growth habits originating from 33 countries across Europe, Asia, and America. We detected strong population structure broadly concordant with growth habit and geography, and identified three major genetic groups: spring (SP), winter Europe (WE), and winter Asia (WA). Subpopulation-specific polymorphism patterns suggest enriched genetic diversity within the WA group and a smaller effective breeding population for the SP group compared to WE. Interestingly, the two subgenomes of B. napus appear to have different geographic origins, with phylogenetic analysis placing WE and WA as basal clades for the other subpopulations in the C and A subgenomes, respectively. Finally, we identified 16 genomic regions where the patterns of diversity differed markedly from the genome-wide average, several of which are suggestive of genomic inversions. The results obtained in this study constitute a valuable resource for worldwide breeding efforts and the genetic dissection and prediction of complex B. napus traits.},

  abstract = {The crucifer oilseed plant false flax (Camelina sativa subsp. sativa) possesses numerous valuable agronomic attributes that make it attractive as an alternative spring-sown crop for tight crop rotations. The oil of false flax is particularly rich in polyunsaturated C18-fatty acids, making it a valuable renewable feedstock for the oleochemical industry. Because of the minimal interest in the crop throughout the 20th century, breeding efforts have been limited. In this study, a genetic map for C. sativa was constructed, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, in a population of recombinant inbred lines that were developed, through single-seed descent, from a cross between `Lindo' and `Licalla', 2 phenotypically distinct parental varieties. Three Brassica simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were also integrated into the map, and 1 of these shows linkage to oil-content loci in both C. sativa and Brassica napus. Fifty-five other SSR primer combinations showed monomorphic amplification products, indicating partial genome homoeology with the Brassica species. Using data from field trials with different fertilization treatments (0 and 80~kg~N/ha) at multiple locations over 3 years, the map was used to localize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed yield, oil content, 1000-seed mass, and plant height. Some yield QTLs were found only with the N0 treatment, and might represent loci contributing to the competitiveness of false flax in low-nutrient soils. The results represent a starting point for future marker-assisted breeding.},

  abstract = {Background: Paradoxically, centromeres are known both for their characteristic repeat sequences (satellite DNA) and for being epigenetically defined. Maize (Zea mays mays) is an attractive model for studying centromere positioning because many of its large ({\textasciitilde}2 Mb) centromeres are not dominated by satellite DNA. These centromeres, which we call complex centromeres, allow for both assembly into reference genomes and for mapping short reads from ChIP-seq with antibodies to centromeric histone H3 (cenH3). Results: We found frequent complex centromeres in maize and its wild relatives Z. mays parviglumis, Z. mays mexicana, and particularly Z. mays huehuetenangensis. Analysis of individual plants reveals minor variation in the positions of complex centromeres among siblings. However, such positional shifts are stochastic and not heritable, consistent with prior findings that centromere positioning is stable at the population level. Centromeres are also stable in multiple F1 hybrid contexts. Analysis of repeats in Z. mays and other species (Zea diploperennis, Zea luxurians, and Tripsacum dactyloides) reveals tenfold differences in abundance of the major satellite CentC, but similar high levels of sequence polymorphism in individual CentC copies. Deviation from the CentC consensus has little or no effect on binding of cenH3. Conclusions: These data indicate that complex centromeres are neither a peculiarity of cultivation nor inbreeding in Z. mays. While extensive arrays of CentC may be the norm for other Zea and Tripsacum species, these data also reveal that a wide diversity of DNA sequences and multiple types of genetic elements in and near centromeres support centromere function and constrain centromere positions.},

Here, we report a detailed, genome-wide characterization of the rate and localization of COs in Arabidopsis thaliana, in male and female meiosis. We observed dramatic differences between male and female meiosis which included: (i) genetic map length; 575 cM versus 332 cM respectively; (ii) CO distribution patterns: male CO rates were very high at both ends of each chromosome, whereas female CO rates were very low; (iii) correlations between CO rates and various chromosome features: female CO rates correlated strongly and negatively with GC content and gene density but positively with transposable elements (TEs) density, whereas male CO rates correlated positively with the CpG ratio. However, except for CpG, the correlations could be explained by the unequal repartition of these sequences along the Arabidopsis chromosome. For both male and female meiosis, the number of COs per chromosome correlates with chromosome size expressed either in base pairs or as synaptonemal complex length. Finally, we show that interference modulates the CO distribution both in male and female meiosis.},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge in population genetics and molecular evolution is to understand the forces shaping the patterns of genetic diversity within and among species. Among them, mating systems are thought to have important influences on molecular diversity and genome evolution. Selfing is expected to reduce effective population size,               N               e               , and effective recombination rates, directly leading to reduced polymorphism and increased linkage disequilibrium compared with outcrossing. Increased isolation between populations also results directly from selfing or indirectly from evolutionary changes, such as small flowers and low pollen output, leading to greater differentiation of molecular markers than under outcrossing. The lower effective recombination rate increases the likelihood of hitch-hiking, further reducing within-deme diversity of selfers and thus increasing their genetic differentiation. There are also indirect effects on molecular evolutionary processes. Low               N               e               reduces the efficacy of selection; in selfers, selection should thus be less efficient in removing deleterious mutations. The rarity of heterozygous sites in selfers leads to infrequent action of biased conversion towards GC, which tends to increase sequences' GC content in the most highly recombining genome regions of outcrossers. To test these predictions in plants, we used a newly developed sequence polymorphism database to investigate the effects of mating system differences on sequence polymorphism and genome evolution in a wide set of plant species. We also took into account other life-history traits, including life form (whether annual or perennial herbs, and woody perennial) and the modes of pollination and seed dispersal, which are known to affect enzyme and DNA marker polymorphism. We show that among various life-history traits, mating systems have the greatest influence on patterns of polymorphism.},

  abstract = {Much evidence indicates that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has a major impact on the evolution of mammalian genomes. However, a detailed quantification of the process is still lacking. The strength of gBGC can be measured from the analysis of derived allele frequency spectra (DAF), but this approach is sensitive to a number of confounding factors. In particular, we show by simulations that the inference is pervasively affected by polymorphism polarization errors and by spatial heterogeneity in gBGC strength. We propose a new general method to quantify gBGC from DAF spectra, incorporating polarization errors, taking spatial heterogeneity into account, and jointly estimating mutation bias. Applying it to human polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that the strength of gBGC does not differ between hypermutable CpG sites and non-CpG sites, suggesting that in humans gBGC is not caused by the base-excision repair machinery. Genome-wide, the intensity of gBGC is in the nearly neutral area. However, given that recombination occurs primarily within recombination hotspots, 1\%{\textendash}2\% of the human genome is subject to strong gBGC. On average, gBGC is stronger in African than in non-African populations, reflecting differences in effective population sizes. However, due to more heterogeneous recombination landscapes, the fraction of the genome affected by strong gBGC is larger in non-African than in African populations. Given that the location of recombination hotspots evolves very rapidly, our analysis predicts that, in the long term, a large fraction of the genome is affected by short episodes of strong gBGC.},

  abstract = {Abstract             GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process mimicking selection in favor of G and C alleles. It is increasingly recognized as a widespread force in shaping the genomic nucleotide landscape. In recombination hotspots, gBGC can lead to bursts of fixation of GC nucleotides and to accelerated nucleotide substitution rates. It was recently shown that these episodes of strong gBGC could give spurious signatures of adaptation and/or relaxed selection. There is also evidence that gBGC could drive the fixation of deleterious amino acid mutations in some primate genes. This raises the question of the potential fitness effects of gBGC. While gBGC has been metaphorically termed the ``Achilles' heel'' of our genome, we do not know whether interference between gBGC and selection merely has practical consequences for the analysis of sequence data or whether it has broader fundamental implications for individuals and populations. I developed a population genetics model to predict the consequences of gBGC on the mutation load and inbreeding depression. I also used estimates available for humans to quantitatively evaluate the fitness impact of gBGC. Surprising features emerged from this model: (i) Contrary to classical mutation load models, gBGC generates a fixation load independent of population size and could contribute to a significant part of the load; (ii) gBGC can maintain recessive deleterious mutations for a long time at intermediate frequency, in a similar way to overdominance, and these mutations generate high inbreeding depression, even if they are slightly deleterious; (iii) since mating systems affect both the selection efficacy and gBGC intensity, gBGC challenges classical predictions concerning the interaction between mating systems and deleterious mutations, and gBGC could constitute an additional cost of outcrossing; and (iv) if mutations are biased toward A and T alleles, very low gBGC levels can reduce the load. A robust prediction is that the gBGC level minimizing the load depends only on the mutational bias and population size. These surprising results suggest that gBGC may have nonnegligible fitness consequences and could play a significant role in the evolution of genetic systems. They also shed light on the evolution of gBGC itself.},

Its genetic basis has been a topic of controversy since the early 20th century. The masking of recessive deleterious mutations in hybrids likely explains a substantial part of heterosis. The dynamics and consequences of these mutations have thus been studied in depth. Recently, it was suggested that GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) might strongly affect the fate of deleterious mutations and may have significant fitness consequences. gBGC is a recombination-associated process mimicking selection in favor of G and C alleles, which can interfere with selection, for instance by increasing the frequency of GC deleterious mutations. I investigated how gBGC could affect the amount and genetic structure of heterosis through an analysis of the interaction between gBGC and selection in subdivided populations. To do so, I analyzed the infinite island model both by numerical computations and by analytical approximations. I showed that gBGC might have little impact on the total amount of heterosis but could greatly affect its genetic basis.},

  abstract = {Cytological evidence indicates that genetic interference can be partitioned into two empirical components: nonrandomness in the number of chiasmata that occur and nonrandomness in the locations of multiple chiasmata. Previous studies have incorporated the first effect into genetic models for analyzing multipoint data. An extension to this approach is presented which allows for the second component of interference by modeling the probability density function of the locations of multiple crossovers. Results of reanalyses of multilocus data for the Drosophila X chromosome show that models that incorporate only the first effect give a better fit to these data than do standard mapping functions and that the extended model significantly improved the fit by decreasing the predicted frequency of multiple crossovers in nearby regions. Our results demonstrate that chiasma-based models of multilocus recombination, which are unique in incorporating direct estimates of the frequency of multiple crossovers for a chromosome region, can provide a powerful and realistic means of accounting for genetic interference when applied to the problems of gene localization, locus ordering, and exclusion mapping.},

A pipeline was developed to convert single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data into genomic bins, which could be used for fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and identification of candidate genes. The pipeline, implemented in a python script named SNPbinner, adopts a hidden Markov model approach for calculation of recombination breakpoints followed by genomic bins construction. The total length of the newly developed high-resolution genetic map was 1.2-fold larger than previously estimated based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR){\textendash}based markers. The map was used to verify and refine QTL previously identified for two fruit quality traits in the RIL population, fruit weight (FW) and fruit lycopene content (LYC). Two well-described FW QTL (fw2.2 and fw3.2) were localized precisely at their known underlying causative genes, and the QTL intervals were decreased by two- to tenfold. A major QTL for LYC content (Lyc12.1) was verified at high resolution and its underlying causative gene was determined to be z-carotene isomerase (SlZISO). The RIL population, the high resolution genetic map, and the easy-to-use genotyping pipeline, SNPbinner, are made publicly available.},

The integrated C. moschata map comprises 205 SSR markers and two morphological traits (Gr and n). The map is composed of 27 linkage groups with a marker density of 7 cM. Comparing the C. moschata map with the published Cucurbita pepo map, we found a high level of macrosynteny. Seventy-two of 76 common SSR markers between C. moschata and C. pepo were located in homologous linkage groups. These markers in general have conserved orders and similar genetic distances; they represent orthologous loci. A reference map based on these SSRs was obtained. No major chromosomal rearrangement between the two species could be detected at present, although four SSR markers were mapped in nonhomologous linkage groups. The comparative alignment of SSR markers did not provide any indication of a possible ancient polyploid origin of the species. The comparative mapping of C. moschata and C. pepo reported here will be useful for further studies on Cucurbit evolution, gene isolation, and breeding work.},

  abstract = {Background: The spread of maize cultivation to the highlands of central Mexico was accompanied by substantial introgression from the endemic wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana, prompting the hypothesis that the transfer of beneficial variation facilitated local adaptation. Methods: We used whole-genome sequence data to map regions of Zea mays ssp. mexicana introgression in three Mexican highland maize individuals. We generated a genetic linkage map and performed Quantitative Trait Locus mapping in an F2 population derived from a cross between lowland and highland maize individuals. Results: Introgression regions ranged in size from several hundred base pairs to Megabase-scale events. Gene density within introgression regions was comparable to the genome as a whole, and over 1,000 annotated genes were located within introgression events. Quantitative Trait Locus mapping identified a small number of loci linked to traits characteristic of Mexican highland maize. Discussion: Although there was no strong evidence to associate quantitative trait loci with regions of introgression, we nonetheless identified many Mexican highland alleles of introgressed origin that carry potentially functional sequence variants. The impact of introgression on stress tolerance and yield in the highland environment remains to be fully characterized.},

To date, little is known about the loci that underlie such genetic variation in fitness or whether the loci influencing fitness are partner specific, and depend on the genotype of the interaction partner. In the legume-rhizobium mutualism, one set of potential candidate genes that may influence the fitness benefits of the symbiosis are the plant genes involved in the initiation of the signaling pathway between the two partners. Here we performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in Medicago truncatula in two different rhizobium strain treatments to locate regions of the genome influencing plant traits, assess whether such regions are dependent on the genotype of the rhizobial mutualist (QTL {$\cdot$} rhizobium strain), and evaluate the contribution of sequence variation at known symbiosis signaling genes. Two of the symbiotic signaling genes, NFP and DMI3, colocalized with two QTL affecting average fruit weight and leaf number, suggesting that natural variation in nodulation genes may potentially influence plant fitness. In both rhizobium strain treatments, there were QTL that influenced multiple traits, indicative of either tight linkage between loci or pleiotropy, including one QTL with opposing effects on growth and reproduction. There was no evidence for QTL {$\cdot$} rhizobium strain or genotype {$\cdot$} genotype interactions, suggesting either that such interactions are due to small-effect loci or that more genotype-genotype combinations need to be tested in future mapping studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Meiotic recombination is the fundamental process that produces balanced gametes and generates diversity within species. For successful meiosis, crossovers must form between homologous chromosomes. This condition is more difficult to fulfill in allopolyploid species, which have more than two sets of related chromosomes (homoeologs). Here, we investigated the formation, progression, and completion of several key hallmarks of meiosis in Brassica napus (AACC), a young polyphyletic allotetraploid crop species with closely related homoeologous chromosomes. Altogether, our results demonstrate a precocious and efficient sorting of homologous versus homoeologous chromosomes during early prophase I in two representative B. napus accessions that otherwise show a genotypic difference in the progression of homologous recombination. More strikingly, our detailed comparison of meiosis in near isogenic allohaploid and euploid plants showed that the mechanism(s) promoting efficient chromosome sorting in euploids is adjusted to promote crossover formation between homoeologs in allohaploids. This suggests that, in contrast to other polyploid species, chromosome sorting is context dependent in B. napus.},

  abstract = {Meiosis, the mechanism of creating haploid gametes, is a complex cellular process observed across sexually reproducing organisms. Fundamental to meiosis is the process of homologous recombination, whereby DNA double-strand breaks are introduced into the genome and are subsequently repaired to generate either noncrossovers or crossovers. Although homologous recombination is essential for chromosome pairing during prophase I, the resulting crossovers are critical for maintaining homolog interactions and enabling accurate segregation at the first meiotic division. Thus, the placement, timing, and frequency of crossover formation must be exquisitely controlled. In this review, we discuss the proteins involved in crossover formation, the process of their formation and designation, and the rules governing crossovers, all within the context of the important landmarks of prophase I. We draw together crossover designation data across organisms, analyze their evolutionary divergence, and propose a universal model for crossover regulation.},

  abstract = {Background: White clover (Trifolium repens L.) is a temperate forage legume with an allotetraploid genome (2n=4{\texttimes}=32) estimated at 1093 Mb. Several linkage maps of various sizes, marker sources and completeness are available, however, no integrated map and marker set has explored consistency of linkage analysis among unrelated mapping populations. Such integrative analysis requires tools for homoeologue matching among populations. Development of these tools provides for a consistent framework map of the white clover genome, and facilitates in silico alignment with the model forage legume, Medicago truncatula. Results: This is the first report of integration of independent linkage maps in white clover, and adds to the literature on methyl filtered GeneThresher{\textregistered}-derived microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers for linkage mapping. Gene-targeted SSR markers were discovered in a GeneThresher{\textregistered} (TrGT) methyl-filtered database of 364,539 sequences, which yielded 15,647 SSR arrays. Primers were designed for 4,038 arrays and of these, 465 TrGT-SSR markers were used for parental consensus genetic linkage analysis in an F1 mapping population (MP2). This was merged with an EST-SSR consensus genetic map of an independent population (MP1), using markers to match homoeologues and develop a multi-population integrated map of the white clover genome. This integrated map (IM) includes 1109 loci based on 804 SSRs over 1274 cM, covering 97\% of the genome at a moderate density of one locus per 1.2 cM. Eighteen candidate genes and one morphological marker were also placed on the IM. Despite being derived from disparate populations and marker sources, the component maps and the derived IM had consistent representations of the white clover genome for marker order and genetic length. In silico analysis at an E-value threshold of 1e-20 revealed substantial co-linearity with the Medicago truncatula genome, and indicates a translocation between T. repens groups 2 and 6 relative to M. truncatula. Conclusions: This integrated genetic linkage analysis provides a consistent and comprehensive linkage analysis of the white clover genome, with alignment to a model forage legume. Associated marker locus information, particularly the homoeologue-specific markers, offers a new resource for forage legume research to enable genetic analysis and improvement of this forage and grassland species.},

Virtually all identified site-specific recombinases fall into one of just two families, the tyrosine recombinases and the serine recombinases, named after the amino acid residue that forms a covalent protein-DNA linkage in the reaction intermediate. Their recombination mechanisms are distinctly different. Tyrosine recombinases break and rejoin single strands in pairs to form a Holliday junction intermediate. By contrast, serine recombinases cut all strands in advance of strand exchange and religation. Many natural systems of site-specific recombination impose sophisticated regulatory mechanisms on the basic recombinational process to favor one particular outcome of recombination over another (for example, excision over inversion or deletion). Details of the site-specific recombination processes have been revealed by recent structural and biochemical studies of members of both families.},

As many as 8599 SNPs could be included, bringing the total number of markers in the current consensus linkage map to 9268. The total length of the sex average map is 3228 cM, considerably smaller than previous estimates using the WU and EL populations, reflecting the higher quality of the new map. The current map consists of 34 linkage groups and covers at least 29 of the 38 autosomes. Sex-specific analysis and comparisons of the maps based on the three individual populations showed prominent heterogeneity in recombination rates between populations, but no significant heterogeneity between sexes. The recombination rates in the F               1               Red Jungle fowl/White Leghorn males and females were significantly lower compared with those in the WU broiler population, consistent with a higher recombination rate in purebred domestic animals under strong artificial selection. The recombination rate varied considerably among chromosomes as well as along individual chromosomes. An analysis of the sequence composition at recombination hot and cold spots revealed a strong positive correlation between GC-rich sequences and high recombination rates. The GC-rich cohesin binding sites in particular stood out from other GC-rich sequences with a 3.4-fold higher density at recombination hot spots versus cold spots, suggesting a functional relationship between recombination frequency and cohesin binding.},

  abstract = {Linkage maps are valuable tools in genetic and genomic studies. For sweet cherry, linkage maps have been constructed using mainly microsatellite markers (SSRs) and, recently, using single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) from a cherry 6K SNP array. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), a new methodology based on high-throughput sequencing, holds great promise for identification of high number of SNPs and construction of high density linkage maps. In this study, GBS was used to identify SNPs from an intra-specific sweet cherry cross. A total of 8,476 high quality SNPs were selected for mapping. The physical position for each SNP was determined using the peach genome, Peach v1.0, as reference, and a homogeneous distribution of markers along the eight peach scaffolds was obtained. On average, 65.6\% of the SNPs were present in genic regions and 49.8\% were located in exonic regions. In addition to the SNPs, a group of SSRs was also used for construction of linkage maps. Parental and consensus high density maps were constructed by genotyping 166 siblings from a `Rainier' x `Rivedel' (Ra x Ri) cross. Using Ra x Ri population, 462, 489 and 985 markers were mapped into eight linkage groups in `Rainier', `Rivedel' and the Ra x Ri map, respectively, with 80\% of mapped SNPs located in genic regions. Obtained maps spanned 549.5, 582.6 and 731.3 cM for `Rainier', `Rivedel' and consensus maps, respectively, with an average distance of 1.2 cM between adjacent markers for both `Rainier' and `Rivedel' maps and of 0.7 cM for Ra x Ri map. High synteny and co-linearity was observed between obtained maps and with Peach v1.0. These new high density linkage maps provide valuable information on the sweet cherry genome, and serve as the basis for identification of QTLs and genes relevant for the breeding of the species.},

  abstract = {Genetic linkage mapping was performed with an interspecific mapping pedigree of 145 full-sib hybrids individuals of Japanese larch{\texttimes}Chinese larch (Larix kaempferi {\texttimes} Larix gmelini). A total of 210 random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used for mapping, and 581 segregating loci were identified. According to pseudo-testcross mapping strategy, we used mapping software to construct parent-specific linkage maps. The constructed linkage maps consisted of 48 sites in 5 linkage groups (four or more sites per group), 4 triplets, 6 linkage pairs for the maternal parent, and covered the map distance of about 546.5 cM, with the average map distance of 11.9 cM between adjacent markers. In addition, 91 sites in 9 linkage groups (four or more sites per group), 2 triplets, and 5 linkage pairs for the male parent covered the map distance of about 262.0 cM; the average map distance between adjacent markers was 6.1 cM. We detected the quantitative traits of the group by composite interval mapping, and analyzed the quantitative trait loci (QTL) with LOD {$\geq$}1.5. During analysis of the relationship between marker loci and traits, we obtained 4 and 20 QTLs, which were related to growth and timber characteristics. We found one QTL each for tracheid length and tracheid Length to Width ratio in Larix Kaempferi and nine, four, and five QTLs for specific gravity of wood, tracheid Length tracheid Width, respectively, in Larix gmelini. The LOD of every QTL was 1.5{\textasciitilde}11.9, and the contribution rate was 0.0105{\textasciitilde}45.9986\%.},

  abstract = {Genetic and physical maps are powerful tools to anchor fragmented draft genome assemblies generated from next-generation sequencing. Currently, two draft assemblies of Nelumbo nucifera, the genomes of `China Antique' and `Chinese Tai-zi', have been released. However, there is presently no information on how the sequences are assembled into chromosomes in N. nucifera. The lack of physical maps and inadequate resolution of available genetic maps hindered the assembly of N. nucifera chromosomes. Here, a linkage map of N. nucifera containing 2371 bin markers [217 577 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] was constructed using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data of 181 F2 individuals and validated by adding 197 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Additionally, a BioNano optical map covering 86.20\% of the `Chinese Tai-zi' genome was constructed. The draft assembly of `Chinese Tai-zi' was improved based on the BioNano optical map, showing an increase of the scaffold N50 from 0.989 to 1.48 Mb. Using a combination of multiple maps, 97.9\% of the scaffolds in the `Chinese Tai-zi' draft assembly and 97.6\% of the scaffolds in the `China Antique' draft assembly were anchored into pseudo-chromosomes, and the centromere regions along the pseudo-chromosomes were identified. An evolutionary scenario was proposed to reach the modern N. nucifera karyotype from the seven ancestral eudicot chromosomes. The present study provides the highest-resolution linkage map, the optical map and chromosome level genome assemblies for N. nucifera, which are valuable for the breeding and cultivation of N. nucifera and future studies of comparative and evolutionary genomics in angiosperms.},

In this study, a genetic linkage map was constructed using sequencerelated amplified polymorphism markers and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers based on an F1 population comprising 120 progeny derived from a cross between Zoysia japonica Z105 (salt-tolerant accession) and Z061 (salt-sensitive accession). The linkage map covered 1211 cM with an average marker distance of 5.0 cM and contained 24 linkage groups with 242 marker loci (217 sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers and 25 random amplified polymorphic DNA markers). Quantitative trait loci affecting the salt tolerance of zoysiagrass were identified using the constructed genetic linkage map. Two significant quantitative trait loci (qLF-1 and qLF-2) for leaf firing percentage were detected; qLF-1 at 36.3 cM on linkage group LG4 with a logarithm of odds value of 3.27, which explained 13.1\% of the total variation of leaf firing and qLF-2 at 42.3 cM on LG5 with a logarithm of odds value of 2.88, which explained 29.7\% of the total variation of leaf firing. A significant quantitative trait locus (qSCW-1) for reduced percentage of dry shoot clipping weight was detected at 44.1 cM on LG5 with a logarithm of odds value of 4.0, which explained 65.6\% of the total variation. This study provides important information for further functional analysis of salt-tolerance genes in zoysiagrass. Molecular markers linked with quantitative trait loci for salt tolerance will be useful in zoysiagrass breeding programs using marker-assisted selection.},

  abstract = {Background: Meiotic recombination happens during the process of meiosis when chromosomes inherited from two parents exchange genetic materials to generate chromosomes in the gamete cells. The recombination events tend to occur in narrow genomic regions called recombination hotspots. Its dysregulation could lead to serious human diseases such as birth defects. Although the regulatory mechanism of recombination events is still unclear, DNA sequence polymorphisms have been found to play crucial roles in the regulation of recombination hotspots. Method: To facilitate the studies of the underlying mechanism, we developed a database named LDSplitDB which provides an integrative and interactive data mining and visualization platform for the genome-wide association studies of recombination hotspots. It contains the pre-computed association maps of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the 1000 Genomes Project and the HapMap Phase III datasets, and a genome-scale study of the European population from the HapMap Phase II dataset. Besides the recombination profiles, related data of genes, SNPs and different types of epigenetic modifications, which could be associated with meiotic recombination, are provided for comprehensive analysis. To meet the computational requirement of the rapidly increasing population genomics data, we prepared a lookup table of 400 haplotypes for recombination rate estimation using the well-known LDhat algorithm which includes all possible two-locus haplotype configurations. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, LDSplitDB is the first large-scale database for the association analysis of human recombination hotspots with DNA sequence polymorphisms. It provides valuable resources for the discovery of the mechanism of meiotic recombination hotspots. The information about MHC in this database could help understand the roles of recombination in human immune system. Database URL: http://histone.scse.ntu.edu.sg/LDSplitDB},

We assembled short-read sequences into 416 Mb draft genome of C. reticulatum and anchored 78\% (327 Mb) of this assembly to eight linkage groups. Genome annotation predicted 25,680 protein-coding genes covering more than 90\% of predicted gene space. The genome assembly shared a substantial synteny and conservation of gene orders with the genome of the model legume Medicago truncatula. Resistance gene homologs of wild and domesticated chickpeas showed high sequence homology and conserved synteny. Comparison of gene sequences and nucleotide diversity using 66 wild and domesticated chickpea accessions suggested that the desi type chickpea was genetically closer to the wild species than the kabuli type. Comparative analyses predicted gene flow between the wild and the cultivated species during domestication. Molecular diversity and population genetic structure determination using 15,096 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed an admixed domestication pattern among cultivated (desi and kabuli) and wild chickpea accessions belonging to three population groups reflecting significant influence of parentage or geographical origin for their cultivar-specific population classification. The assembly and the polymorphic sequence resources presented here would facilitate the study of chickpea domestication and targeted use of wild Cicer germplasms for agronomic trait improvement in chickpea.},

Results               A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20~766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the `100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.

  abstract = {Understanding the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is crucial to evolutionary genomics because the crossover rate determines how strongly a genome region is influenced by natural selection on linked sites. Nevertheless, generalities in the chromosome-scale distribution of crossovers have not been investigated formally. We fill this gap by synthesizing joint information on genetic and physical maps across 62 animal, plant and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis reveals a strong and taxonomically widespread reduction of the crossover rate in the centre of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position of the centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative reduction in the crossover rate in chromosome centres increases with chromosome length. That is, long chromosomes often display a dramatically low crossover rate in their centre, whereas short chromosomes exhibit a relatively homogeneous crossover rate. This observation is compatible with a model in which crossover is initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with preliminary support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic recombination. Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher genome-wide crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing theory and providing empirical examples, we finally highlight that taxonomically widespread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover rate along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in genetic diversity and population differentiation by modifying the impact of natural selection among regions within a genome. We conclude by emphasizing that chromosomescale heterogeneity in crossover rate should urgently be incorporated into analytical tools in evolutionary genomics, and in the interpretation of resulting patterns.},

  abstract = {The two alleles at a heterozygous locus segregate during meiosis, sometimes at meiosis I and sometimes at meiosis II. The timing of segregation is determined by the pattern of crossing-over between a locus and its attached centromeres. Genes near centromeres can exploit this process by driving against spores from which the genes separated at meiosis I. Other genes, located distal to centromeres, can benefit from driving against spores from which they separated at meiosis II. Asymmetric female meiosis is particularly susceptible to such forms of drive. Selection on modifiers of recombination favors changes in the location of chiasmata that increase the proportion of tetrads of high average fitness by changing the timing of segregation. Such changes increase the frequency of driving alleles. This source of selection on recombination does not depend on effects on linkage disequilibrium. Recombinational responses to meiotic drive may contribute to sex differences in overall recombination and sex differences in the localization of chiasmata.},

  abstract = {Human recombination and mutation mapped                            Genetic recombination is an essential process in generating genetic diversity. Recombination occurs both through the shuffling of maternal and paternal chromosomes and through mutations generated by resolution of the physical breaks necessary for this process. Halldorsson               et al.               sequenced the full genomes of parents and offspring to create a map of human recombination and estimate the relationship with de novo mutations. Interestingly, transcribed regions of the genome were less likely to have crossovers, suggesting that there may be selection to reduce changes in genetic sequences via recombination or mutation in these regions.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaau1043                        ,              A high-resolution human genetic map from whole genomes identifies patterns of recombination and de novo mutation.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Diversity in the sequence of the human genome, arising from recombinations and mutations, is fundamental to human evolution and human diversity. Meiotic recombination is initiated from double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs occur more frequently in regions of the genome termed hotspots, and a small subset eventually gives rise to crossovers, a reciprocal exchange of large pieces between homologous chromosomes. The majority of DSBs do not lead to crossovers but end as localized transfers of short segments between homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids, observable as gene conversions when the segment includes a heterozygous marker. Crossovers co-occurring with distal gene conversions are known as complex crossovers.                                         RATIONALE               Current meiotic recombination maps either have limited resolution or the events cannot be resolved to an individual level. The detection of recombination and de novo mutations (DNMs) requires genetic data on a proband and its parents, and a fine resolution of these events is possible only with whole-genome sequence data. Whole-genome sequencing and DNA microarray data allowed us to identify crossovers and DNMs in families at a high resolution. We resolved crossovers at an individual level, allowing us to examine variation in crossover patterns between individuals, analyzing which crossovers are complex and how crossover patterns are influenced by age, sex, sequence variants, and epigenomic factors. It is known that the mutation rate is increased near crossovers, but the rate of DNMs near crossovers has been characterized only indirectly or at a small scale.                                         RESULTS               We show that a number of epigenomic factors influence crossover location, shifting crossovers from exons to enhancers. Complex crossovers are more common in females than males, and the rate of complex crossovers increases with maternal age. Maternal age also correlates with an increase in the recombination rate in general and a shift in the location of crossovers toward later-replicating regions and regions of lower GC content. Both sexes show an {\textasciitilde}50-fold increase in DNMs within 1 kb of crossovers, but the types of DNMs differ considerably between the sexes. Females, but not males, also exhibit an increase in the mutation rate up to 40 kb from crossovers, particularly at complex crossovers. We found 47 variants at 35 loci affecting the recombination rate and/or the location of crossover, 24 of which are coding or splice region variants. Whereas some of the variants affect both the recombination rate and several measures of crossover location in both sexes, other variants affect only one of these measures in one of the sexes. Many of these variants are in genes that encode the synaptonemal complex.                                         CONCLUSION               Our genome-wide recombination map provides a resolution of 682 base pairs. We show that crossovers have a direct mutagenic effect and demonstrate that DNMs and crossovers accumulate in the same regions with advancing maternal age. Furthermore, our results illustrate extensive genetic control of meiotic recombinations and highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers.                                                   Our search for crossovers in parents and their offspring.                   Histone modifications influence crossover location. The DNM rate is higher within 1 kb from a crossover in both sexes, but the type of mutations differs between the sexes. The DNM rate is also higher up to 40 kb from crossovers in females with enrichment of G{\textrightarrow}C mutations. We used crossovers from many individuals to construct genetic maps and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the recombination rate and attributes of crossover locations to search for genes that control crossover characteristics.                                                                         ,              Genetic diversity arises from recombination and de novo mutation (DNM). Using a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequence data on parent-child pairs, we identified 4,531,535 crossover recombinations and 200,435 DNMs. The resulting genetic map has a resolution of 682 base pairs. Crossovers exhibit a mutagenic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of crossovers in males and females. In females, a higher mutation rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from crossovers, particularly for complex crossovers, which increase with maternal age. We identified 35 loci associated with the recombination rate or the location of crossovers, demonstrating extensive genetic control of meiotic recombination, and our results highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers.},

  abstract = {Reduction of fitness due to deleterious mutations imposes a limit to adaptive evolution. By characterizing features that influence this genetic load we may better understand constraints on responses to both natural and human-mediated selection. Here, using whole-genome, transcriptome, and methylome data from {$>$} 600 Arabidopsis thaliana individuals, we set out to identify important features influencing selective constraint. Our analyses reveal that multiple factors underlie the accumulation of maladaptive mutations, including gene expression level, gene network connectivity, and gene-body methylation. We then focus on a feature with major effect, nucleotide composition. The ancestral vs. derived status of segregating alleles suggests that GC-biased gene conversion, a recombination-associated process that increases the frequency of G and C nucleotides regardless of their fitness effects, shapes sequence patterns in A. thaliana. Through estimation of mutational effects, we present evidence that biased gene conversion hinders the purging of deleterious mutations and contributes to a genome-wide signal of decreased efficacy of selection. By comparing these results to two outcrossing relatives, Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella grandiflora, we find that protein evolution in A. thaliana is as strongly affected by biased gene conversion as in the outcrossing species. We last perform simulations to show that natural levels of outcrossing in A. thaliana are sufficient to facilitate biased gene conversion despite increased homozygosity due to selfing. Together, our results show that even predominantly selfing taxa are susceptible to biased gene conversion, suggesting that it may constitute an important constraint to adaptation among plant species.},

We report patterns of short and medium range (up to100 kb) LD in six unlinked genomic regions in the partially selfing domesticated grass, Sorghum bicolor. The extent of allelic associations in S. bicolor, as assessed by pairwise measures of LD, is higher than in maize but lower than in Arabidopsis, in qualitative agreement with expectations based on mating system. Quantitative analyses of the population recombination parameter, {$\rho$}, however, based on empirical estimates of rates of recombination, mutation, and self-pollination, show that LD is more extensive than expected under a neutral equilibrium model. The disparity between {$\rho$} and the population mutation parameter, {\texttheta}, is similar to that observed in other species whose population history appears to be complex. From a practical standpoint, these results suggest that S. bicolor is well suited for association studies using reasonable numbers of markers, since LD typically extends at least several kilobases but has largely decayed by 15 kb.},

  abstract = {To add detail to the genetic map of Arabidopsis lyrata, and compare it with that of A. thaliana, we have developed many additional markers in the A. lyrata linkage groups, LG1 and LG2, corresponding to A. thaliana chromosome 1. We used a newly developed method for marker development for single nucleotide polymorphisms present in gene sequences, plus length differences, to map genes in an A. lyrata family, including variants in several genes close to the A. thaliana centromere 1, providing the first data on the location of an A. lyrata centromere ; we discuss the implications for the evolution of chromosome 1 of A. thaliana. With our larger marker density, large rearrangements between the two Arabidopsis species are excluded, except for a large inversion on LG2. This was previously known in Capsella; its presence in A. lyrata suggests that, like most other rearrangements, it probably arose in the A. thaliana lineage. Knowing that marker orders are similar, we can now compare homologous, non-rearranged map distances to test the prediction of more frequent crossing-over in the more inbreeding species. Our results support the previous conclusion of similar distances in the two species for A. lyrata LG1 markers. For LG2 markers, the distances were consistently, but non-significantly, larger in A. lyrata. Given the two species' large DNA content difference, the similarity of map lengths, particularly for LG1, suggests that crossing-over is more frequent across comparable physical distances in the inbreeder, A. thaliana, as predicted.},

  abstract = {Controlled pedigrees and the multi-decade timescale of national crop plant breeding programs offer a unique experimental context for examining how selection affects plant genomes. More than 3000 wheat cultivars have been registered, released, and documented since 1949 in China. In this study, a set of 145 elite cultivars selected from historical points of wheat breeding in China were re-sequenced. A total of 43.75 Tb of sequence data were generated with an average read depth of 17.943 for each cultivar, and more than 60.92 million SNPs and 2.54 million InDels were captured, based on the Chinese Spring RefSeq genome v1.0. Seventy years of breeder-driven selection led to dramatic changes in grain yield and related phenotypes, with distinct genomic regions and phenotypes targeted by different breeders across the decades. There are very clear instances illustrating how introduced Italian and other foreign germplasm was integrated into Chinese wheat programs and reshaped the genomic landscape of local modern cultivars. Importantly, the resequencing data also highlighted significant asymmetric breeding selection among the three sub-genomes: this was evident in both the collinear blocks for homeologous chromosomes and among sets of three homeologous genes. Accumulation of more newly assembled genes in newer cultivars implied the potential value of these genes in breeding. Conserved and extended sharing of linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks was highlighted among pedigree-related cultivars, in which fewer haplotype differences were detected. Fixation or replacement of haplotypes from founder genotypes after generations of breeding was related to their breeding value. Based on the haplotype frequency changes in LD blocks of pedigree-related cultivars, we propose a strategy for evaluating the breeding value of any given line on the basis of the accumulation (pyramiding) of beneficial haplotypes. Collectively, our study demonstrates the influence of ``founder genotypes'' on the output of breeding efforts over many decades and also suggests that founder genotype perspectives are in fact more dynamic when applied in the context of modern genomics-informed breeding.},

Within diploid and polyploid ryegrass and fescue species, including the forage grass perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the presence of B chromosomes has been reported as influencing both chromosome pairing and chiasma frequencies. In this study, the effects of the presence/absence of B chromosomes on genetic recombination has been investigated through generating DArT (Diversity Arrays Technology) marker genetic maps for six perennial ryegrass diploid populations, the pollen parents of which contained either two B or zero B chromosomes. Through genetic and cytological analyses of these progeny and their parents, we have identified that, while overall cytological estimates of chiasma frequencies were significantly lower in pollen mother cells with two B chromosomes as compared with zero B chromosomes, the recombination frequencies within some marker intervals were actually increased, particularly for marker intervals in lower recombination regions of chromosomes, namely pericentromeric regions. Thus, in perennial ryegrass, the presence of two B chromosomes redistributed patterns of meiotic recombination in pollen mother cells in ways which could increase the range of allelic variation available to plant breeders.},

  abstract = {Crossovers are essential in meiosis of most organisms to ensure the proper segregation of chromosomes, but improper placement of crossovers can result in nondisjunction and aneuploidy in progeny. In particular, crossovers near the centromere can cause nondisjunction. Centromere-proximal crossovers are suppressed by what is termed the centromere effect, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we investigate contributions to centromere-proximal crossover suppression in Drosophila melanogaster. We mapped a large number of centromere-proximal crossovers, and find that crossovers are essentially absent from the highly repetitive (HR)heterochromatin surrounding the centromere but occur at a low frequency within the less-repetitive (LR)-heterochromatic region and adjacent euchromatin. Previous research suggested that flies that lack the Bloom syndrome helicase (Blm) lose meiotic crossover patterning, including the centromere effect. Mapping of centromere-proximal crossovers in Blm mutants reveals that the suppression within the HR-heterochromatin is intact, but the distance-dependent centromere effect is lost. We conclude that centromere-proximal crossovers are suppressed by two separable mechanisms: an HR-heterochromatin effect that completely suppresses crossovers in the HR-heterochromatin, and the centromere effect, which suppresses crossovers with a dissipating effect with distance from the centromere.},

Here, we show how evolutionary forces affecting selection, including recombination and effective population size, drive genomic patterns of allele-specific expression (ASE). Integrating tissue-specific genotypic and transcriptomic data from 1500 individuals from two different cohorts, we demonstrate that ASE is less often observed in regions of low recombination, and loci in high or normal recombination regions are more efficient at using ASE to underexpress harmful mutations. By tracking genetic ancestry, we discriminate between ASE variability due to past demographic effects, including subsequent bottlenecks, versus local environment. We observe that ASE is not randomly distributed along the genome and that population parameters influencing the efficacy of natural selection alter ASE levels genome wide.           ,              Recombination, population size, and environment contribute to altered allelic expression of damaging mutations.},

  abstract = {Recombination confers a major evolutionary advantage by breaking up linkage disequilibrium between harmful and beneficial mutations, thereby facilitating selection. However, in species that are only periodically sexual, such as many microbial eukaryotes, the realized rate of recombination is also affected by the frequency of sex, meaning that infrequent sex can increase the effects of selection at linked sites despite high recombination rates. Despite this, the rate of sex of most facultatively sexual species is unknown. Here, we use genomewide patterns of linkage disequilibrium to infer fine-scale recombination rate variation in the genome of the facultatively sexual green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We observe recombination rate variation of up to two orders of magnitude and find evidence of recombination hotspots across the genome. Recombination rate is highest flanking genes, consistent with trends observed in other nonmammalian organisms, though intergenic recombination rates vary by intergenic tract length. We also find a positive relationship between nucleotide diversity and physical recombination rate, suggesting a widespread influence of selection at linked sites in the genome. Finally, we use estimates of the effective rate of recombination to calculate the rate of sex that occurs in natural populations, estimating a sexual cycle roughly every 840 generations. We argue that the relatively infrequent rate of sex and large effective population size creates a population genetic environment that increases the influence of selection on linked sites across the genome.},

We tested the downstream effects of the population-specific recombination rates in statistical phasing and genotype imputation in Finns as compared to the same analyses performed by using the NFE-based recombination rates. We found that Finnish recombination rates have a moderately high correlation (Spearman's {$\rho$} = 0.67{\textendash}0.79) with NFE, although on average (across all autosomal chromosomes), Finnish rates (2.268 {$\pm$} 0.4209 cM/Mb) are 12{\textendash}14\% lower than NFE (2.641 {$\pm$} 0.5032 cM/Mb).

Our results suggest that haplotype phasing and genotype imputation mostly depend on population-specific contexts like appropriate reference panels and their sample size, but not on population-specific recombination maps. Even though recombination rate estimates had some differences between the Finnish and NFE populations, haplotyping and imputation had not been noticeably affected by the recombination map used. Therefore, the currently available HapMap recombination maps seem robust for population-specific phasing and imputation pipelines, even in the context of relatively isolated populations like Finland.},

Thus, upstream sequences of divergently transcribed genes (bi-directional upstream regions, or URs) may be more constrained than those of uni-directional gene pairs. We investigated this effect by analyzing nucleotide variation segregating within and between Arabidopsis species. Compared to uni-directional URs, bi-directional URs indeed display lower population mutation rate, as well as more low-frequency polymorphisms. Furthermore, we find that bi-directional regions undergo selection for the maintenance of intergenic distance. Altogether, however, we observe considerable variation in evolutionary rates, with putative signatures of selection on two uni-directional upstream regions.},

Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a recently developed technology that allows massive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be identified and high-resolution genotyping. In our current research, we generated the first genetic map of O. fragrans using SLAF-seq, which is composed with 206.92 M paired-end reads and 173,537 SLAF markers. Among total 90,715 polymorphic SLAF markers, 15,317 polymorphic SLAFs could be used for genetic map construction. The integrated map contained 14,189 high quality SLAFs that were grouped in 23 genetic linkage groups, with a total length of 2962.46 cM and an average distance of 0.21 cM between two adjacent markers. In addition, 23,664 SNPs were identified from the mapped markers. As far as we know, this is the first of the genetic map of O. fragrans. Our results are further demonstrate that SLAF-seq is a very effective method for developing markers and constructing high-density linkage maps. The SNP markers and the genetic map reported in this study should be valuable resource in future research.},

  abstract = {Recombination shapes the evolutionary trajectory of populations and plays an important role in the faithful transmission of chromosomes during meiosis. Levels of sexual reproduction and recombination are important properties of host{\textendash}pathogen interactions because the speed of antagonistic co-evolution depends on the ability of hosts and pathogens to generate genetic variation. However, our understanding of the importance of recombination is limited because large taxonomic groups remain poorly investigated. Here, we analyze recombination rate variation in the basidiomycete fungus Armillaria ostoyae, which is an aggressive pathogen on a broad range of conifers and other trees. We analyzed a previously constructed, dense genetic map based on 198 single basidiospore progeny from a cross. Progeny were genotyped at a genome-wide set of singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing. Based on a linkage map of on 11,700 SNPs spanning 1007.5 cM, we assembled genomic scaffolds into 11 putative chromosomes of a total genome size of 56.6 Mb. We identified 1984 crossover events among all progeny and found that recombination rates were highly variable along chromosomes. Recombination hotspots tended to be in regions close to the telomeres and were more gene-poor than the genomic background. Genes in proximity to recombination hotspots were encoding on average shorter proteins and were enriched for pectin degrading enzymes. Our analyses enable more powerful population and genome-scale studies of a major tree pathogen.},

  abstract = {Sex, as well as meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes, is nearly ubiquitous among eukaryotes. In those species that use it, recombination is important for chromosome segregation during gamete production, and thus for fertility. Strikingly, although in most species only one crossover event per chromosome is required to ensure proper segregation, recombination rates vary considerably above this minimum and show variation within and among species. However, whether this variation in recombination is adaptive or neutral and what might shape it remain unclear. Empirical studies and theory support the idea that recombination is generally beneficial but can also have costs. Here, we review variation in genome-wide recombination rates, explore what might cause this, and discuss what is known about its mechanistic basis. We end by discussing the environmental sensitivity of meiosis and recombination rates, how these features may relate to adaptation, and their implications for a broader understanding of recombination rate evolution.

We propose a novel approach for estimating population recombination rates based on genotyping or sequence data that involves a sequential multiscale change point estimator. Our method also permits demography to be taken into account. It uses several summary statistics within a regression model fitted on suitable scenarios. Our proposed method is accurate, computationally fast, and provides a parsimonious solution by ensuring a type I error control against too many changes in the recombination rate. An application to human genome data suggests a good congruence between our estimated and experimentally identified hotspots.

  abstract = {An essential component of the homologous recombination machinery in eukaryotes, the RAD54 protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of helicases with dsDNA-dependent ATPase, DNA translocase, DNA supercoiling and chromatin remodelling activities. It is a motor protein that translocates along dsDNA and performs multiple functions in homologous recombination. In particular, RAD54 is an essential cofactor for regulating RAD51 activity. It stabilizes the RAD51 nucleofilament, remodels nucleosomes, and stimulates the homology search and strand invasion activities of RAD51. Accordingly, deletion of RAD54 has dramatic consequences on DNA damage repair in mitotic cells. In contrast, its role in meiotic recombination is less clear. RAD54 is essential for meiotic recombination in Drosophila and C. elegans, but plays minor roles in yeast and mammals. We present here characterization of the roles of RAD54 in meiotic recombination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Absence of RAD54 has no detectable effect on meiotic recombination in otherwise wild-type plants but RAD54 becomes essential for meiotic DSB repair in absence of DMC1. In Arabidopsis, dmc1 mutants have an achiasmate meiosis, in which RAD51 repairs meiotic DSBs. Lack of RAD54 leads to meiotic chromosomal fragmentation in absence of DMC1. The action of RAD54 in meiotic RAD51 activity is thus mainly downstream of the role of RAD51 in supporting the activity of DMC1. Equivalent analyses show no effect on meiosis of combining dmc1 with the mutants of the RAD51-mediators RAD51B, RAD51D and XRCC2. RAD54 is thus required for repair of meiotic DSBs by RAD51 and the absence of meiotic phenotype in rad54 plants is a consequence of RAD51 playing a RAD54-independent supporting role to DMC1 in meiotic recombination.},

  abstract = {Populationgeneticmodelsoften use a population recombination parameter 4Nc, where N is the effective population size and cis the recombination rate per generation. mInany ways 4Nc is comparable to 4Nu, the population mutation rate.Both combine genome level and population level processes, and together they describe the rate of productionof genetic variationin a population.However, 4Nc is more difficult to estimate. For a population sample of DNA sequences, historical recombination can only be detected if polymorphisms exist, and even then most recombination events are not detectable. This paper describesanestimator of 4Nc, hereafterdesignated y (gamma), that was developed using a coalescent model for a sample of four DNA sequences with recombination. The reliability of y was assessed using multiple coalescent simulations. In generyalhas low to moderate bias, and the reliability of is comparable, though less, than thatfor a widely used estimator of 4Nu. If there exists an independent estimate of the recombination rate (per generation, perbase pair), y can be used to estimate the effective population size or the neutral mutation rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Rose is the world's most important ornamental plant, with economic, cultural and symbolic value. Roses are cultivated worldwide and sold as garden roses, cut flowers and potted plants. Roses are outbred and can have various ploidy levels. Our objectives were to develop a high-quality reference genome sequence for the genus               Rosa               by sequencing a doubled haploid, combining long and short reads, and anchoring to a high-density genetic map, and to study the genome structure and genetic basis of major ornamental traits. We produced a doubled haploid rose line (`HapOB') from               Rosa chinensis               `Old Blush' and generated a rose genome assembly anchored to seven pseudo-chromosomes (512\,Mb with N50 of 3.4\,Mb and 564 contigs). The length of 512\,Mb represents 90.1{\textendash}96.1\% of the estimated haploid genome size of rose. Of the assembly, 95\% is contained in only 196 contigs. The anchoring was validated using high-density diploid and tetraploid genetic maps. We delineated hallmark chromosomal features, including the pericentromeric regions, through annotation of transposable element families and positioned centromeric repeats using fluorescent in situ hybridization. The rose genome displays extensive synteny with the               Fragaria vesca               genome, and we delineated only two major rearrangements. Genetic diversity was analysed using resequencing data of seven diploid and one tetraploid               Rosa               species selected from various sections of the genus. Combining genetic and genomic approaches, we identified potential genetic regulators of key ornamental traits, including prickle density and the number of flower petals. A rose               APETALA2/TOE               homologue is proposed to be the major regulator of petal number in rose. This reference sequence is an important resource for studying polyploidization, meiosis and developmental processes, as we demonstrated for flower and prickle development. It will also accelerate breeding through the development of molecular markers linked to traits, the identification of the genes underlying them and the exploitation of synteny across Rosaceae.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination results in the formation of cytological structures known as chiasmata at the sites of genetic crossovers (COs). The formation of at least one chiasma/CO between homologous chromosome pairs is essential for accurate chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division as well as for generating genetic variation. Although DNA double-strand breaks, which initiate recombination, are widely distributed along the chromosomes, this is not necessarily reflected in the chiasma distribution. In many species there is a tendency for chiasmata to be distributed in favored regions along the chromosomes, whereas in others, such as barley and some other grasses, chiasma localization is extremely pronounced. Localization of chiasma to the distal regions of barley chromosomes restricts the genetic variation available to breeders. Studies reviewed herein are beginning to provide an explanation for chiasma localization in barley. Moreover, they suggest a potential route to manipulating chiasma distribution that could be of value to plant breeders.},

It is then easily possible to generalize from computer runs at only one population size. All computer runs assumed an initial population at linkage equilibrium between the two loci. Analysis of the results was greatly simplified by considering the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first (defined as the proportion of replicate lines in which the favoured allele was eventually fixed).

(iv) Under conditions of suitable relative gene effects, the influence of segregation at the second locus was very dependent on the initial frequency of the desirable allele.

When the advance under selection is most sensitive to changes in recombination value, a doubling of the latter in no case increased the advance under selection by more than about 6\%. The proportion selected to give maximum advance under individual selection (0{$\cdot$}5 under independent segregation) was increased, but only very slightly, when linkage is important.

  abstract = {Summary             Although the expected relationship or proportion of genome shared by pairs of relatives can be obtained from their pedigrees, the actual quantities deviate as a consequence of Mendelian sampling and depend on the number of chromosomes and map length. Formulae have been published previously for the variance of actual relationship for a number of specific types of relatives but no general formula for non-inbred individuals is available. We provide here a unified framework that enables the variances for distant relatives to be easily computed, showing, for example, how the variance of sharing for great grandparent{\textendash}great grandchild, great uncle{\textendash}great nephew, half uncle{\textendash}nephew and first cousins differ, even though they have the same expected relationship. Results are extended in order to include differences in map length between sexes, no recombination in males and sex linkage. We derive the magnitude of skew in the proportion shared, showing the skew becomes increasingly large the more distant the relationship. The results obtained for variation in actual relationship apply directly to the variation in actual inbreeding as both are functions of genomic coancestry, and we show how to partition the variation in actual inbreeding between and within families. Although the variance of actual relationship falls as individuals become more distant, its coefficient of variation rises, and so, exacerbated by the skewness, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish different pedigree relationships from the actual fraction of the genome shared.},

  abstract = {Sequencing and the single sperm                            During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo doublestrand breaks in DNA that can cross over, shuffling genetic material. However, not every double-strand break resolves in a crossover event. Hinch               et al.               wanted to determine the rules governing DNA recombination. They developed a method to sequence individual mouse sperm and applied it to mice carrying two different alleles of a protein involved in mammalian crossovers. A high-resolution genetic map revealed the relationships between the distribution of crossovers, proteins involved in recombination, and specific factors determining whether a double-strand break becomes a crossover.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaau8861                        ,              A high-resolution map from single-cell sequencing identifies factors responsible for crossover resolution in individual murine sperm cells.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               In diploid organisms, the two chromosomes in each homologous pair act independently of each other during most cellular functions. An exception occurs in meiosis, in which the pair of chromosomes must first locate each other in the cell nucleus and then physically exchange genetic material through recombination and crossing over. This physical exchange is mechanistically essential for proper chromosomal segregation in meiosis. Along with mutation, it also shapes patterns of genetic variation in natural populations, providing the substrate on which natural selection acts. Recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Repairing these breaks entails a search for the matching sequence in the homologous chromosome. Although DSBs are predominantly repaired using the homolog as template, only a small proportion result in the formation of crossovers.                                         RATIONALE               Most DSBs occur in narrow regions called recombination hotspots, defined in mice and many other species by the DNA binding specificities of the protein PRDM9. Despite recent progress, much remains unknown about the molecular processes occurring during meiosis and the factors affecting repair outcomes for individual DSBs. We have developed and applied a method for whole-genome amplification and DNA sequencing of single sperm to provide genome-wide maps of crossovers with unprecedented resolution. We combined this with molecular assays for various meiotic stages: H3K4me3 (which measures PRDM9 binding), SPO11-oligos (which count DSBs), and DMC1 on single-stranded DNA (which measures the number and persistence of DSBs).                                         RESULTS               We report single-cell sequencing of 217 sperm from a hybrid mouse. We inferred 2649 crossovers genome-wide, resolved to a median resolution of 916 base pairs (bp), with 386 crossovers resolved within 250 bp.                                By comparing our high-resolution crossover map with stage-specific molecular measures of recombination, we identify four factors that strongly increase the chance that a particular DSB will resolve as a crossover: (i) whether PRDM9 has bound the uncut template chromosome (the chromosome used for repair) at the site of the DSB, (ii) the proximity of the hotspot to the telomere, (iii) local GC content, and (iv) the                 Prdm9                 allelic type of the hotspot. We show that each of these four factors also consistently decreases homolog engagement time, specifically the time until single-stranded DNA at the DSB site has located and invaded the DNA duplex of its homolog.                              We show that the precise location of the breakpoint in a crossover{\textemdash}the switchpoint from one homolog to the other{\textemdash}is also affected by whether PRDM9 has bound the template. Crossover breakpoints are modulated by the chromatin environment of the template chromosome, avoiding positions occupied by nucleosomes. We also find that the pseudoautosomal region, which must have a crossover in males, is likely determined by cis-acting factors and has a higher than expected use of hotspots that are activated independently of PRDM9.                                         CONCLUSION               Our work identifies several additional roles for PRDM9 in meiosis beyond positioning DSBs. We show that the breaks that are fastest to engage their homolog are more likely to repair as crossovers. Each of the contributing factors we identified also suggests mechanisms that could facilitate the otherwise seemingly intractable challenge of homology search.                                                   Identification of crossovers in sperm and factors affecting the repair of double-strand breaks in meiosis.                   (Top) Meiotic cells undergo programmed double-strand breaks, some of which resolve as crossovers. DNA sequencing of single sperm identifies sites of crossover. (Bottom) A double-strand break is more likely to engage its homolog quickly (and to resolve as a crossover) if PRDM9 binds the same location on the homologous chromosome, if it is near the telomere, or if the local GC content is high.                                                                         ,              Recombination is critical to meiosis and evolution, yet many aspects of the physical exchange of DNA via crossovers remain poorly understood. We report an approach for single-cell whole-genome DNA sequencing by which we sequenced 217 individual hybrid mouse sperm, providing a kilobase-resolution genome-wide map of crossovers.

We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing ca. 250 oak species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use reversible-jump MCMC to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the {$>$} 20,000 RAD-seq loci back to a recently published oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny. Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60\% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification due to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity. The support we find for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression. Oaks are phylogenomic mosaics, and their diversity may in fact depend on the gene flow that shapes the oak genome.},

  abstract = {Background: The genus Musa is a large species complex which includes cultivars at diploid and triploid levels. These sterile and vegetatively propagated cultivars are based on the A genome from Musa acuminata, exclusively for sweet bananas such as Cavendish, or associated with the B genome (Musa balbisiana) in cooking bananas such as Plantain varieties. In M. acuminata cultivars, structural heterozygosity is thought to be one of the main causes of sterility, which is essential for obtaining seedless fruits but hampers breeding. Only partial genetic maps are presently available due to chromosomal rearrangements within the parents of the mapping populations. This causes large segregation distortions inducing pseudo-linkages and difficulties in ordering markers in the linkage groups. The present study aims at producing a saturated linkage map of M. acuminata, taking into account hypotheses on the structural heterozygosity of the parents. Results: An F1 progeny of 180 individuals was obtained from a cross between two genetically distant accessions of M. acuminata, 'Borneo' and 'Pisang Lilin' (P. Lilin). Based on the gametic recombination of each parent, two parental maps composed of SSR and DArT markers were established. A significant proportion of the markers (21.7\%) deviated (p {$<$} 0.05) from the expected Mendelian ratios. These skewed markers were distributed in different linkage groups for each parent. To solve some complex ordering of the markers on linkage groups, we associated tools such as tree-like graphic representations, recombination frequency statistics and cytogenetical studies to identify structural rearrangements and build parsimonious linkage group order. An illustration of such an approach is given for the P. Lilin parent. Conclusions: We propose a synthetic map with 11 linkage groups containing 489 markers (167 SSRs and 322 DArTs) covering 1197 cM. This first saturated map is proposed as a "reference Musa map" for further analyses. We also propose two complete parental maps with interpretations of structural rearrangements localized on the linkage groups. The structural heterozygosity in P. Lilin is hypothesized to result from a duplication likely accompanied by an inversion on another chromosome. This paper also illustrates a methodological approach, transferable to other species, to investigate the mapping of structural rearrangements and determine their consequences on marker segregation.},

To assist in analysis of the sweet potato genome, de novo whole-genome sequencing was performed with two lines of I. trifida, namely the selfed line Mx23Hm and the highly heterozygous line 0431-1, using the Illumina HiSeq platform. We classified the sequences thus obtained as either `core candidates' (common to the two lines) or `line specific'. The total lengths of the assembled sequences of Mx23Hm (ITR\_r1.0) was 513 Mb, while that of 0431-1 (ITRk\_r1.0) was 712 Mb. Of the assembled sequences, 240 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 353 Mb (0431-1) were classified into core candidate sequences. A total of 62,407 (62.4 Mb) and 109,449 (87.2 Mb) putative genes were identified, respectively, in the genomes of Mx23Hm and 0431-1, of which 11,823 were derived from core sequences of Mx23Hm, while 28,831 were from the core candidate sequence of 0431-1. There were a total of 1,464,173 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 16,682 copy number variations (CNVs) in the two assembled genomic sequences (under the condition of log2 ratio of {$>$}1 and CNV size {$>$}1,000 bases). The results presented here are expected to contribute to the progress of genomic and genetic studies of I. trifida, as well as studies of the sweet potato and the genus Ipomoea in general.},

This lack of accuracy assessment calls into question conclusions from a wide range of research that depends explicitly or implicitly on TE annotation. In the absence of standard benchmarks, toolmakers are impeded in improving their tools, annotators cannot properly assess which tools might best suit their needs, and downstream researchers cannot judge how accuracy limitations might impact their studies. We therefore propose that the TE research community create and adopt standard TE annotation benchmarks, and we call for other researchers to join the authors in making this long-overdue effort a success.},

To test if PRDM9 also directs recombination in non-mammalian vertebrates, we focused on an exemplar species, the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus). Unlike birds, this species possesses a single, intact PRDM9 ortholog. By inferring historical recombination rates along the genome from patterns of linkage disequilibrium and identifying crossovers in pedigrees, we found that PRDM9 specifies the location of recombination events outside of mammals. However, we also detected an independent effect of promoter-like features on recombination, which is more pronounced on macro- than microchromosomes. Thus, our findings reveal that the uses of PRDM9 and promoter-like features are not mutually-exclusive, and instead reflect a tug of war, which varies in strength along the genome and is more lopsided in some species than others.},

The notion that integral segments of DNA have been transferred from one gene to another in these cases has, however, met considerable resistance. We have devised a PCR assay detecting only the molecule that results if the E beta d-derived fragment analogous to that introduced in the bm12 mutation is transferred to the A beta k gene. We have proceeded to analyze sperm from the F1 cross C3H/HeJ (haplotype k) x BALB/c (haplotype d). In our assay, we find that the frequency for conversion of this particular DNA segment is 2 x 10(-6). This frequency is relevant only in the germ line; when liver cells were tested as an example of somatic cells, no events were observed, implying a frequency of {$<$} 2 x 10(-8) in liver.

Like in many other crops, sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) breeding is increasingly supported by the application of such genetic markers. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based markers have a high potential for automated analysis and high-throughput genotyping. We developed a bioinformatics workflow that uses Sanger and 2nd-generation sequence data for detection, evaluation and verification of new transcript-associated SNPs from sugar beet. RNAseq data from one parent of an established mapping population were produced by 454-FLX sequencing and compared to Sanger ESTs derived from the other parent. The workflow established for SNP detection considers the quality values of both types of reads, provides polymorphic alignments as well as selection criteria for reliable SNP detection and allows painless generation of new genetic markers within genes. We obtained a total of 14,323 genic SNPs and InDels. According to empirically optimised settings for the quality parameters, we classified these SNPs into four usability categories. Validation of a subset of the in silico detected SNPs by genotyping the mapping population indicated a high success rate of the SNP detection. Finally, a total of 307 new markers were integrated with existing data into a new genetic map of sugar beet which offers improved resolution and the integration of terminal markers.},

We examine genome-wide genetic diversity in Spirodela polyrhiza, a duckweed that reproduces primarily asexually.   We find that this geographically widespread and numerically abundant species has very low levels of genetic diversity. Diversity at nonsynonymous sites relative to synonymous sites is high, suggesting that purifying selection is weak. A potential explanation for this observation is that a very low frequency of sex renders selection ineffective. However, there is a pronounced decay in linkage disequilibrium over 40 kb, suggesting that though sex may be rare at the individual level it is not too infrequent at the population level. In addition, neutral diversity is affected by the physical proximity of selected sites, which would be unexpected if sex was exceedingly rare at the population level.},

  abstract = {To avoid negative effects of transposable element (TE) proliferation, plants epigenetically silence TEs using a number of mechanisms, including RNA-directed DNA methylation. These epigenetic modifications can extend outside the boundaries of TE insertions and lead to silencing of nearby genes, resulting in a trade-off between TE silencing and interference with nearby gene regulation. Therefore, purifying selection is expected to remove silenced TE insertions near genes more efficiently and prevent their accumulation within a population. To explore how effects of TE silencing on gene regulation shapes purifying selection on TEs, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 166 individuals of a large population of the outcrossing species Capsella grandiflora. We found that most TEs are rare, and in chromosome arms, silenced TEs are exposed to stronger purifying selection than those that are not silenced by 24-nucleotide small RNAs, especially with increasing proximity to genes. An age-of-allele test of neutrality on a subset of TEs supports our inference of purifying selection on silenced TEs, suggesting that our results are robust to varying transposition rates. Our results provide new insights into the processes affecting the accumulation of TEs in an outcrossing species and support the view that epigenetic silencing of TEs results in a trade-off between preventing TE proliferation and interference with nearby gene regulation. We also suggest that in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions, the negative aspects of epigenetic TE silencing are missing.},

To effectively transfer these genes into Gossypium hirsutum, an entire microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR)-based genetic map was constructed using the interspecific cross of G. hirsutum {\texttimes} G. tomentosum (HT). We detected 1800 loci from 1347 pairs of polymorphic primers. Of these, 1204 loci were grouped into 35 linkage groups at LOD {$\geq$} 4. The map covers 3320.8 cM, with a mean density of 2.76 cM per locus. We detected 420 common loci (186 in the At subgenome and 234 in Dt) between the HT map and the map of TM-1 (G. hirsutum) and Hai 7124 (G. barbadense; HB map). The linkage groups were assigned chromosome numbers based on location of common loci and the HB map as reference. A comparison of common markers revealed that no significant chromosomal rearrangement exist between G. tomentosum and G. barbadense. Interestingly, however, we detected numerous (33.7\%) segregation loci deviating from 3:1 ratio (P {$<$} 0.05) in HT, mostly clustering on eight chromosomes in the Dt subgenome, with some on three chromosomes in At. Two morphological traits, leaf hairiness and leaf nectarilessness were mapped on chromosomes 6 (A6) and 26 (D12), respectively. The SSR-based map constructed in this study will be useful for further genetic studies on cotton breeding, including mapping loci controlling quantitative traits associated with fiber quality, stress tolerance and developing chromosome segment specific introgression lines from G. tomentosum into G. hirsutum using marker-assisted selection.},

  abstract = {X and Y chromosomes differ in effective population size (Ne), rates of recombination, and exposure to natural selection, all of which can affect patterns of genetic diversity. On Y chromosomes with suppressed recombination, natural selection is expected to eliminate linked neutral variation, and lower the Ne of Y compared to X chromosomes or autosomes. However, female-biased sex ratios and high variance in male reproductive success can also reduce Y-linked Ne, making it difficult to infer the causes of low Y-diversity. Here, we investigate the factors affecting levels of polymorphism during sex chromosome evolution in the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus (Polygonaceae). Strikingly, we find that neutral diversity for genes on the Y chromosome is, on average, 2.1\% of the value for their X-linked homologs, corresponding to a chromosome-wide reduction of 93\% compared to the standard neutral expectation. We demonstrate that the magnitude of this diversity loss is inconsistent with reduced male Ne caused by neutral processes. Instead, using forward simulations and estimates of the distribution of deleterious fitness effects, we show that Y chromosome diversity loss can be explained by purifying selection acting in aggregate over a large number of genetically linked sites. Simulations also suggest that our observed level of Y-diversity is consistent with the joint action of purifying and positive selection, but only for models in which there were fewer constrained sites than we empirically estimated. Given the relatively recent origin of R. hastatulus sex chromosomes, our results imply that Y-chromosome degeneration in the early stages may be largely driven by selective interference rather than by neutral genetic drift of silenced Y-linked genes.},

We discuss differences in selection as they relate to variation in demography, recombination, mating system, and ploidy. We focus on the population genetic consequences of these factors and argue that, although variation in the magnitude of purifying selection is well documented, quantifying rates of positive selection and disentangling the relative importance of recombination, demography, and ploidy are ongoing challenges.

  abstract = {Forest trees can increase our understanding of how evolutionary processes drive the genomic landscape and understand speciation due to the majority of forest trees being distributed widely and able to adapt to different climates and environments. Populus davidiana and Populus tremula are among the most geographically widespread and ecologically important tree species in Northern Hemisphere. Whole-genome resequencing data of 41 individuals of P. davidiana and P. tremula throughout Eurasia was conducted, finding that genetic differentiation was evident between the two species, the FST values between P. davidiana and P. tremula was 0.3625. The ancestors of the two aspen diverged into P. davidiana and P. tremula species approximately 3.60 million years ago (Mya), which was in accordance with the rapid uplift of Qinghai{\textendash}Tibet Plateau (QTP) around the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. The two species experienced a considerable long-term bottleneck after divergence, with population expansion beginning approximately 20,000 years ago after the end of the last glacial maximum. Although the majority of regions of genomic differentiation between the two species can be explained by neutral evolutionary processes, some outlier regions have also been tested that are significantly influenced by natural selection. We found that the highly differentiated regions of the two species exhibited significant positive selection characteristics, and also identified long-term balancing selection in the poorly differentiated regions in both species. Our results provide strong support for a role of linked selection in generating the heterogeneous genomic landscape of differentiation between P. davidiana and P. tremula. These results provide the detailed and comprehensive genomic insights into genetic diversity, demography, genetic burden, and adaptation in P. davidiana and P. tremula.},

  abstract = {Adaptive archaic hominin genes                            As they migrated out of Africa and into Europe and Asia, anatomically modern humans interbred with archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The result of this genetic introgression on the recipient populations has been of considerable interest, especially in cases of selection for specific archaic genetic variants. Hsieh               et al.               characterized adaptive structural variants and copy number variants that are likely targets of positive selection in Melanesians. Focusing on population-specific regions of the genome that carry duplicated genes and show an excess of amino acid replacements provides evidence for one of the mechanisms by which genetic novelty can arise and result in differentiation between human genomes.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaax2083                        ,              Melanesians carry adaptive DNA variants derived from archaic hominins.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Characterizing genetic variants underlying local adaptations in human populations is one of the central goals of evolutionary research. Most studies have focused on adaptive single-nucleotide variants that either arose as new beneficial mutations or were introduced after interbreeding with our now-extinct relatives, including Neanderthals and Denisovans. The adaptive role of copy number variants (CNVs), another well-known form of genomic variation generated through deletions or duplications that affect more base pairs in the genome, is less well understood, despite evidence that such mutations are subject to stronger selective pressures.                                         RATIONALE               This study focuses on the discovery of introgressed and adaptive CNVs that have become enriched in specific human populations. We combine whole-genome CNV calling and population genetic inference methods to discover CNVs and then assess signals of selection after controlling for demographic history. We examine 266 publicly available modern human genomes from the Simons Genome Diversity Project and genomes of three ancient hominins{\textemdash}a Denisovan, a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains in Siberia, and a Neanderthal from Croatia. We apply long-read sequencing methods to sequence-resolve complex CNVs of interest specifically in the Melanesians{\textemdash}an Oceanian population distributed from Papua New Guinea to as far east as the islands of Fiji and known to harbor some of the greatest amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry.                                         RESULTS                                Consistent with the hypothesis of archaic introgression outside Africa, we find a significant excess of CNV sharing between modern non-African populations and archaic hominins (                 P                 = 0.039). Among Melanesians, we observe an enrichment of CNVs with potential signals of positive selection (                 n                 = 37 CNVs), of which 19 CNVs likely introgressed from archaic hominins. We show that Melanesian-stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signals of positive selection (                 P                 = 0.0323). Many map near or within genes associated with metabolism (e.g.,                 ACOT1                 and                 ACOT2                 ), development and cell cycle or signaling (e.g.,                 TNFRSF10D                 and                 CDK11A                 and                 CDK11B                 ), or immune response (e.g.,                 IFNLR1                 ). We characterize two of the largest and most complex CNVs on chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 that introgressed from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively, and are absent from most other human populations. At chromosome 16p11.2, we sequence-resolve a large duplication of {$>$}383 thousand base pairs (kbp) that originated from Denisovans and introgressed into the ancestral Melanesian population 60,000 to 170,000 years ago. This large duplication occurs at high frequency ({$>$}79\%) in diverse Melanesian groups, shows signatures of positive selection, and maps adjacent to                 Homo sapiens                 {\textendash}specific duplications that predispose to rearrangements associated with autism. On chromosome 8p21.3, we identify a Melanesian haplotype that carries two CNVs, a {\textasciitilde}6-kbp deletion, and a {\textasciitilde}38-kbp duplication, with a Neanderthal origin and that introgressed into non-Africans 40,000 to 120,000 years ago. This CNV haplotype occurs at high frequency (44\%) and shows signals consistent with a partial selective sweep in Melanesians. Using long-read sequencing genomic and transcriptomic data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history for these two CNVs and discover previously undescribed duplicated genes (                 TNFRSF10D1                 ,                 TNFRSF10D2                 , and                 NPIPB16                 ) that show an excess of amino acid replacements consistent with the action of positive selection.                                                        CONCLUSION               Our results suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation that is absent from current reference genomes.                                                   Large adaptive-introgressed CNVs at chromosomes 8p21.3 and 16p11.2 in Melanesians.                                        The magnifying glasses highlight structural differences between the archaic (top) and reference (bottom) genomes. Neanderthal (red) and Denisovan (blue) haplotypes encompassing large CNVs occur at high frequencies in Melanesians (44 and 79\%, respectively) but are absent (black) in all non-Melanesians. These CNVs create positively selected genes (                     TNFRSF10D1                     ,                     TNFRSF10D2                     ,                                          and                     NPIPB16                     ) that are absent from the reference genome.                                                                                            ,              Copy number variants (CNVs) are subject to stronger selective pressure than single-nucleotide variants, but their roles in archaic introgression and adaptation have not been systematically investigated. We show that stratified CNVs are significantly associated with signatures of positive selection in Melanesians and provide evidence for adaptive introgression of large CNVs at chromosomes 16p11.2 and 8p21.3 from Denisovans and Neanderthals, respectively. Using long-read sequence data, we reconstruct the structure and complex evolutionary history of these polymorphisms and show that both encode positively selected genes absent from most human populations. Our results collectively suggest that large CNVs originating in archaic hominins and introgressed into modern humans have played an important role in local population adaptation and represent an insufficiently studied source of large-scale genetic variation.},

In addition to the large body of genetic, physiological and biochemical data gathered for this plant, it will be the first higher plant genome to be completely sequenced, with completion expected at the end of the year 2000. The sequencing effort has been coordinated by an international collaboration, the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). The rationale for intensive investigation of Arabidopsis is that it is an excellent model for higher plants. In order to maximize use of the knowledge gained about this plant, there is a need for a comprehensive database and information retrieval and analysis system that will provide user-friendly access to Arabidopsis information.

Founders were crossed pairwise to produce four F1 hybrids. These F1s were crossed according to a diallel scheme. The resulting offspring was then selfed for three generations. The F4 generation was genotyped with SNP and microsatellite markers. Data for flowering time and leaf morphology traits were determined in the F5 generation. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for these traits was performed using especially developed mixed-model methodology, allowing tests for QTL main effects, QTL by background interactions, and QTL by QTL interactions. Because RILs were genotyped in the F4 generation and phenotyped in the F5 generation, residual heterozygosity could be used to confirm and fine-map a number of the QTLs in the selfed progeny of lines containing such heterozygosity. The AMPRIL population is an attractive resource for the study of complex traits.},

  abstract = {Background: Meiosis is a specialized cell division that underpins sexual reproduction in most eukaryotes. During meiosis, interhomolog meiotic recombination facilitates accurate chromosome segregation and generates genetic diversity by shuffling parental alleles in the gametes. The frequency of meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis has a U-shaped curve in response to environmental temperature, and is dependent on the Type I, crossover (CO) interference-sensitive pathway. The mechanisms that modulate recombination frequency in response to temperature are not yet known. Results: In this study, we compare the transcriptomes of thermally-stressed meiotic-stage anthers from msh4 and mus81 mutants that mediate the Type I and Type II meiotic recombination pathways, respectively. We show that heat stress reduces the number of expressed genes regardless of genotype. In addition, msh4 mutants have a distinct gene expression pattern compared to mus81 and wild type controls. Interestingly, ASY1, which encodes a HORMA domain protein that is a component of meiotic chromosome axes, is up-regulated in wild type and mus81 but not in msh4. In addition, SDS the meiosis-specific cyclin-like gene, DMC1 the meiosis-specific recombinase, SYN1/REC8 the meiosis-specific cohesion complex component, and SWI1 which functions in meiotic sister chromatid cohesion are up-regulated in all three genotypes. We also characterize 51 novel, previously unannotated transcripts, and show that their promoter regions are associated with A-rich meiotic recombination hotspot motifs. Conclusions: Our transcriptomic analysis of msh4 and mus81 mutants enhances our understanding of how the Type I and Type II meiotic CO pathway respond to environmental temperature stress and might provide a strategy to manipulate recombination levels in plants.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, is the most devastating disease in citrus worldwide. Commercial citrus varieties including sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) are highly susceptible to HLB, and trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata, a close Citrus relative) is widely considered resistant or highly tolerant to HLB. In this study, an intergeneric F1 population of sweet orange and trifoliate orange was genotyped by Genotyping-bySequencing, and high-density SNP-based genetic maps were constructed separately for trifoliate orange and sweet orange. The two genetic maps exhibited high synteny and high coverage of the citrus genome. Progenies of the F1 population and their parents were planted in a replicated field trial, exposed to intense HLB pressure for 3 years, and then evaluated for susceptibility to HLB over 2 years. The F1 population exhibited a wide range in severity of HLB foliar symptom and canopy damage. Genome-wide QTL analysis based on the phenotypic data of foliar symptom and canopy damage in 2 years identified three clusters of repeatable QTLs in trifoliate orange linkage groups LG-t6, LG-t8 and LG-t9. Co-localization of QTLs for two traits was observed within all three regions. Additionally, one cluster of QTLs in sweet orange (linkage group LG-s7) was also detected. The majority of the identified QTLs each explained 18{\textendash}30\% of the phenotypic variation, indicating their major role in determining HLB responses. These results show, for the first time, a quantitative genetic nature yet the presence of major loci for the HLB tolerance in trifoliate orange. The results suggest that sweet orange also contains useful genetic factor(s) for improving HLB tolerance in commercial citrus varieties. Findings from this study should be very valuable and timely to researchers worldwide as they are hastily searching for genetic solutions to the devastating HLB crisis through breeding, genetic engineering, or genome editing.},

Cavendish-type bananas, which have a monospecific Musa acuminata origin (AAA), account for around half of the global banana production, thereby are of great significance for human societies. However, until now, the high-quality haplotype-resolved reference genome was still undecoded for banana cultivars. Here, we reported the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) and haplotype-resolved reference genome of `Baxijiao' (Cavendish) consisting of three haploid assemblies. The sizes of the three haploid assemblies were estimated to be 477.16 Mb, 477.18 Mb, and 469.57 Mb, respectively. Although with monospecific origins, the three haploid assemblies showed great differences with low levels of sequence collinearity. Several large reciprocal translocations were identified among chromosomes 1, 4 and 7. An expansion of gene families that might affect fruit quality and aroma was detected, such as those belonging to sucrose/disaccharide/oligosaccharide catabolic processes, sucrose metabolic process, starch metabolic process, and aromatic compound biosynthetic process. Besides, an expansion of gene families related to anther and pollen development was observed, which could be associated with parthenocarpy and sterility of the Cavendish cultivar. Finally, much fewer resistance genes were identified in `Baxijiao' than in M. acuminata, particularly in the gene clusters in chromosomes 3 and 10, providing potential targets to explore for molecular analysis of disease resistance in banana. This T2T haplotype-resolved reference genome will thus be a valuable genetic resource for biological studies, molecular breeding and genetic improvement of banana.},

To provide a single reference linkage map for eucalypts a composite map was produced through the integration of data from seven independent mapping experiments (1950 individuals) using a marker-merging method. Results: The composite map totalled 1107 cM and contained 4101 markers; comprising 3880 DArT, 213 microsatellite and eight candidate genes. Eighty-one DArT markers were mapped to two or more linkage groups, resulting in the 4101 markers being mapped to 4191 map positions. Approximately 13\% of DArT markers mapped to identical map positions, thus the composite map contained 3634 unique loci at an average interval of 0.31 cM. Conclusion: The composite map represents the most saturated linkage map yet produced in Eucalyptus. As the majority of DArT markers contained on the map have been sequenced, the map provides a direct link to the E. grandis genome sequence and will serve as an important reference for progressing eucalypt research.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary significance of hybridization and subsequent introgression has long been appreciated, but evaluation of the genome-wide effects of these phenomena has only recently become possible. Crop-wild study systems represent ideal opportunities to examine evolution through hybridization. For example, maize and the conspecific wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana (hereafter, mexicana) are known to hybridize in the fields of highland Mexico. Despite widespread evidence of gene flow, maize and mexicana maintain distinct morphologies and have done so in sympatry for thousands of years. Neither the genomic extent nor the evolutionary importance of introgression between these taxa is understood. In this study we assessed patterns of genome-wide introgression based on 39,029 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 189 individuals from nine sympatric maize-mexicana populations and reference allopatric populations. While portions of the maize and mexicana genomes appeared resistant to introgression (notably near known cross-incompatibility and domestication loci), we detected widespread evidence for introgression in both directions of gene flow. Through further characterization of these genomic regions and preliminary growth chamber experiments, we found evidence suggestive of the incorporation of adaptive mexicana alleles into maize during its expansion to the highlands of central Mexico. In contrast, very little evidence was found for adaptive introgression from maize to mexicana. The methods we have applied here can be replicated widely, and such analyses have the potential to greatly inform our understanding of evolution through introgressive hybridization. Crop species, due to their exceptional genomic resources and frequent histories of spread into sympatry with relatives, should be particularly influential in these studies.},

This mutation accumulates more sugar and is present in most commercial hybrids developed for the processing and fresh markets. The ten pseudochromosomes cover 92\% of the total assembly and 99\% of the estimated genome size, with a scaffold N50 of 222.2\,Mb. This reference genome completely assembles the large structural variation that created the mutant               sh2-R               allele. Furthermore, comparative genomics analysis with six field corn genomes highlights differences in single-nucleotide polymorphisms, structural variations, and transposon composition. Phylogenetic analysis of 5,381 diverse maize and teosinte accessions reveals genetic relationships between sweet corn and other types of maize. Our results show evidence for a common origin in northern Mexico for modern sweet corn in the U.S. Finally, population genomic analysis identifies regions of the genome under selection and candidate genes associated with sweet corn traits, such as early flowering, endosperm composition, plant and tassel architecture, and kernel row number. Our study provides a high-quality reference-genome sequence to facilitate comparative genomics, functional studies, and genomic-assisted breeding for sweet corn.},

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence transcription and how these are coordinated in cells to ensure normal gene expression remains rudimentary. Here, we reveal that actively transcribed CpG island-associated gene promoters recruit SET1 chromatin modifying complexes to enable gene expression. Counterintuitively, this effect is independent of SET1 complex histone modifying activity, and instead relies on the capacity of these complexes to interact with the RNA Polymerase II-binding protein, WDR82. Unexpectedly, we discover that SET1 complexes sustain gene transcription by counteracting the activity of the ZC3H4/WDR82 protein complex, which we show can pervasively terminate both genic and extragenic transcription. Therefore, we discover a new gene regulatory mechanism whereby CpG island elements nucleate a protein complex that protects genic transcription from premature termination, effectively distinguishing genic from non-genic transcription to enable gene expression.},

To facilitate reuse of these data, we constructed and characterized an integrated 459,304-SNP dataset for 10,323 sorghum genotypes on the version 3.1 reference genome. The SNP distribution showed high enrichment in subtelomeric chromosome arms and in genic regions (48\% of SNPs) and was highly correlated (r = 0.82) to the distribution of ApeKI restriction sites. The genetic structure reflected population differences by botanical race, as well as familial structure among recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Faster linkage disequilibrium decay was observed in the diversity panel than in the RILs, as expected, given the greater opportunity for recombination in diverse populations. To validate the quality and utility of the integrated SNP dataset, we used genomewide association studies (GWAS) of genebank phenotype data, precisely mapping several known genes (e.g Y1 and Z) and identifying novel associations for other traits. We further validated the dataset with GWAS of new and published plant height and flowering time data in a nested association mapping population, precisely mapping known genes and identifying epistatic interactions underlying both traits. These findings validate this integrated SNP dataset as a useful genomics resource for sorghum genetics and breeding.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Accurate estimation of recombination rates is critical for studying the origins and maintenance of genetic diversity. Because the inference of recombination rates under a full evolutionary model is computationally expensive, we developed an alternative approach using topological data analysis (TDA) on genome sequences. We find that this method can analyze datasets larger than what can be handled by any existing recombination inference software, and has accuracy comparable to commonly used model-based methods with significantly less processing time. Previous TDA methods used information contained solely in the first Betti number ({$\beta$}1) of a set of genomes, which aims to capture the number of loops that can be detected within a genealogy. These explorations have proven difficult to connect to the theory of the underlying biological process of recombination, and, consequently, have unpredictable behavior under perturbations of the data. We introduce a new topological feature, which we call {$\psi$}, with a natural connection to coalescent models, and present novel arguments relating {$\beta$}1 to population genetic models. Using simulations, we show that {$\psi$} and {$\beta$}1 are differentially affected by missing data, and package our approach as TREE (Topological Recombination Estimator). TREE's efficiency and accuracy make it well suited as a first-pass estimator of recombination rate heterogeneity or hotspots throughout the genome. Our work empirically and theoretically justifies the use of topological statistics as summaries of genome sequences and describes a new, unintuitive relationship between topological features of the distribution of sequence data and the footprint of recombination on genomes.},

  abstract = {During meiotic prophase I chromosomes undergo dramatic conformational changes that accompany chromosome condensation, pairing and recombination between homologs. These changes include the anchoring of telomeres to the nuclear envelope and their clustering to form a bouquet. In plants, these events have been studied and illustrated in intact meiocytes of species with large genomes. Arabidopsis thaliana is an excellent genetic model in which major molecular pathways that control synapsis and recombination between homologs have been uncovered. Yet the study of chromosome dynamics is hampered by current cytological methods that disrupt the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the nucleus. Here we set up a protocol to preserve the 3D configuration of A. thaliana meiocytes. We showed that this technique is compatible with the use of a variety of antibodies that label structural and recombination proteins and were able to highlight the presence of clustered synapsis initiation centers at the nuclear periphery. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization we also studied the behavior of chromosomes during pre-meiotic G2 and prophase I, revealing the existence of a telomere bouquet during A. thaliana male meiosis. In addition we showed that the number of telomeres in a bouquet and its volume vary greatly, thus revealing the complexity of telomere behavior during meiotic prophase I. Finally, by using probes that label subtelomeric regions of individual chromosomes, we revealed differential localization behaviors of chromosome ends. Our protocol opens new areas of research for investigating chromosome dynamics in A. thaliana meiocytes.},

However, a high-resolution genetic map was lacking. Gummy stem blight (Gsb) is a destructive disease responsible for considerable economic losses during melon production. We herein describe the development of an ultra-dense genetic map consisting of 12,932 recombination bin markers covering 1,818 cM, with an average distance of 0.17 cM between adjacent tags. A comparison of the genetic maps for melon, watermelon, and cucumber revealed chromosome-level syntenic relationships and recombination events among the three Cucurbitaceae species. Our genetic map was useful for re-anchoring the genome scaffolds of melon. More than 92\% assembly was anchored to 12 pseudo-chromosomes and 90\% of them were oriented. Furthermore, 1,135 recombination hotspots revealed an unbalanced recombination rate across the melon genome. Genetic analyses of the Gsb-resistant and -susceptible lines indicated the resistance phenotype is mediated by a single dominant gene. We identified Gsb-resistance gene candidates in a 108-kb region on pseudo-chromosome 4. Our findings verify the utility of an ultra-dense genetic map for mapping a gene of interest, and for identifying new disease resistant genes.},

As allopolyploid speciation combines the range of genetic and ecological characteristics of divergent diploids, allopolyploids initially show their additivity and are predicted to evolve differentiated ecological niches to establish in face of their competition. Here, we use four diploid wild wheats that differentially combined into four independent allopolyploid species to test for such additivity and assess the impact of ecological constraints on species ranges. Divergent genetic variation from diploids being fixed in heterozygote allopolyploids supports their genetic additivity. Spatial integration of comparative phylogeography and modelling of climatic niches supports ecological additivity of locally adapted diploid progenitors into allopolyploid species which subsequently colonised wide ranges. Allopolyploids fill suitable range to a larger extent than diploids and conservative evolution following the combination of divergent species appears to support their expansion under environmental changes.},

Only recently have SNP markers been available to researchers in soybean [Glycine max (L.)

Our objectives were to add 2500 additional SNP markers to the soybean integrated map and select a set of 1536 SNPs to create a universal linkage panel for high-throughput soybean quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The GoldenGate assay is one high-throughput analysis method capable of genotyping 1536 SNPs in 192 DNA samples over a 3-d period. We designed GoldenGate assays for 3456 SNPs (2956 new plus 500 previously mapped) which were used to screen three recombinant inbred line populations and diverse germplasm. A total of 3000 workable assays were obtained which added about 2500 new SNP markers to create a fourth version of the soybean integrated linkage map. To create a ``Universal Soy Linkage Panel'' (USLP 1.0) of 1536 SNP loci, SNPs were selected based on even distribution throughout each of the 20 consensus linkage groups and to have a broad range of allele frequencies in diverse germplasm. The 1536 USLP 1.0 will be able to quickly create a comprehensive genetic map in most QTL mapping populations and thus will serve as a useful tool for high-throughput QTL mapping.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of recombination rates are of great importance for understanding evolution. In an experimental genetic cross, recombination breaks apart and rejoins genetic material, such that the genomes of the resulting isolates are comprised of distinct blocks of differing parental origin. We here describe a method exploiting this fact to infer genomewide recombination profiles from sequenced isolates from an advanced intercross line (AIL). We verified the accuracy of the method against simulated data. Next, we sequenced 192 isolates from a twelve-generation cross between West African and North American yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and inferred the underlying recombination landscape at a fine genomic resolution (mean segregating site distance 0.22 kb). Comparison was made with landscapes inferred for a similar cross between four yeast strains, and with a previous single-generation, intra-strain cross (Mancera et al., Nature 2008). Moderate congruence was identified between landscapes (correlation 0.58{\textendash}0.77 at 5 kb resolution), albeit with variance between mean genome-wide recombination rates. The multiple generations of mating undergone in the AILs gave more precise inference of recombination rates than could be achieved from a single-generation cross, in particular in identifying recombination cold-spots. The recombination landscapes we describe have particular utility; both AILs are part of a resource to study complex yeast traits (see e.g. Parts et al., Genome Res 2011). Our results will enable future applications of this resource to take better account of local linkage structure heterogeneities. Our method has general applicability to other crossing experiments, including a variety of experimental designs.},

This study hypothesized that the primary function of these regions may be to enhance the frequency of meiotic recombination between genes, thereby reducing selective interference and improving the efficacy of selec tion. To test this hypothesis, computer simulations were conducted using the slim4 software to examine the impact of varying lengths of intergenic regions on total f itness. Populations with extended intergenic regions exhibited increased total fit ness. Notably, the average fitness effects of both advantageous and deleterious mu tations diminished, implying an enhanced selection efficiency, particularly for mu tations with marginal fitness impacts. Total fitness effect of deleterious mutatio ns increased despite the average fitness effect decreasing. Linkage between delete rious mutations could contribute to purging of slightly deleterious mutations.Thes e results underscore the need for a more comprehensive examination of the relation ship between recombination and intergenic regions to fully elucidate their evoluti onary significance and contribution to genomic architecture.},

  abstract = {Abstract             I have studied nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium using multilocus data from 77 fragments, with an average length of fragments of 550 bp, in the deciduous tree Populus tremula (Salicaceae). The frequency spectrum across loci showed a modest excess of mutations segregating at low frequency and a marked excess of high-frequency derived mutations at silent sites, relative to neutral expectations. These excesses were also seen at replacement sites, but were not so pronounced for high-frequency derived mutations. There was a marked excess of low-frequency mutations at replacement sites, likely indicating deleterious amino acid-changing mutations that segregate at low frequencies in P. tremula. I used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to evaluate a number of different demographic scenarios and to estimate parameters for the best-fitting model. The data were found to be consistent with a historical reduction in the effective population size of P. tremula through a bottleneck. The timing inferred for this bottleneck is largely consistent with geological data and with data from several other long-lived plant species. The results show that P. tremula harbors substantial levels of nucleotide polymorphism with the posterior mode of the scaled mutation rate, {\texttheta} = 0.0177 across loci. The ABC analyses also provided an estimate of the scaled recombination rate that indicates that recombination rates in P. tremula are likely to be 2{\textendash}10 times higher than the mutation rate. This study reinforces the notion that linkage disequilibrium is low and decays to negligible levels within a few hundred base pairs in P. tremula.},

Several genetic linkage maps were constructed for the olive (Olea europaea L.) genome, mainly using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. However, AFLPs and SSR markers were not enough to develop a high-density olive linkage map. Genotypingby-sequencing (GBS), a recently developed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification methodology based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, has been demonstrated to be useful for the identification of a high number of SNP markers and the construction of high-density genetic linkage maps. In the present study, we identified a total of 10,941 SNPs from a cross between the olive cultivars `Gemlik' and `Edincik Su' using GBS and de novo SNP discovery implemented in the computer program ``Stacks.'' A high-density genetic linkage map for the olive genome was constructed using 121 cross-pollinated full-sib F1 progeny and 5643 markers (21 SSRs, 203 AFLPs, and 5736 SNPs). This linkage map was composed of 25 linkage groups, covering 3049 cM of the olive genome, and the mean distance between the flanking markers was 0.53 cM. To the best of our knowledge, this map is the most saturated genetic linkage map in olive to date.},

  abstract = {Background: Yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) is a promising grain legume for productive and sustainable crop rotations. It has the advantages of high tolerance to soil acidity and excellent seed quality, but its current yield potential is poor, especially in low rainfall environments. Key adaptation traits such as phenology and enhanced stress tolerance are often complex and controlled by several genes. Genomic-enabled technologies may help to improve our basic understanding of these traits and to provide selective markers in breeding. However, in yellow lupin there are very limited genomic resources to support research and no published information is available on the genetic control of adaptation traits. Results: We aimed to address these deficiencies by developing the first linkage map for yellow lupin and conducting quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of yield under well-watered (WW) and water-deficit (WT) conditions. Two next-generation sequencing marker approaches - genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and Diversity Array Technology (DArT) sequencing - were employed to genotype a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a bi-parental cross between wild and domesticated parents. A total of 2,458 filtered single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and presence / absence variation (PAV) markers were used to develop a genetic map comprising 40 linkage groups, the first reported for this species. A number of significant QTLs controlling total biomass and 100-seed weight under two water (WW and WD) regimes were found on linkage groups YL-03, YL-09 and YL-26 that together explained 9 and 28\% of total phenotypic variability. QTLs associated with length of the reproductive phase and time to flower were found on YL-01, YL-21, YL-35 and YL-40 that together explained a total of 12 and 44\% of total phenotypic variation. Conclusion: These genomic resources and the QTL information offer significant potential for use in marker-assisted selection in yellow lupin.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Genetic variation of the entire genome represents population structure, yet individual loci can show distinct patterns. Such deviations identified through genome scans have often been attributed to effects of selective factors instead of randomness, assuming that the genomic intervals are long enough to average out randomness in underlying genealogies. However, an alternative explanation to distinct patterns has not been fully addressed: too few genealogies to average out the effect of randomness. Specifically, distinct patterns of genetic variation may be due to reduced local recombination rate, since the number of genealogies in a genomic interval corresponds to the number of ancestral recombination events. Here, we associate distinct patterns of local genetic variation with reduced recombination rate in a songbird, the Eurasian blackcap, using genome sequences and recombination maps. We find that distinct patterns of local genetic variation represent haplotype structure at low-recombining regions present either in all populations or only in a few populations. At the former species-wide low- recombining regions, genetic variation depicts conspicuous haplotypes segregating in multiple populations. On the contrary, at the latter population-specific low-recombining regions, genetic variation primarily represents cryptic haplotype structure among individuals of the low-recombining populations. With simulations, we confirm that reduction in recombination rate alone can cause distinct patterns of genetic variation mirroring our empirical data. Our results highlight that distinct patterns of genetic variation can emerge through evolution of reduced local recombination rate. Recombination landscape as an evolvable trait therefore plays an important role determining the heterogeneous distribution of genetic variation along the genome.},

However, recent advances in sequencing technology provide opportunities to resolve these difficulties. Using next-generation sequencing and gene-targeting sequence capture, 12,551 nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the common wheat varieties `Hatsumochi' and `Kitahonami' and were assigned to chromosome arms using International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium survey sequences. Because the number of markers for D genome chromosomes in commercially available wheat single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is insufficient, we developed markers using a genome-specific amplicon sequencing strategy. Approximately 80\% of the designed primers successfully amplified D genome-specific products, suggesting that by concentrating on a specific subgenome, we were able to design successful markers as efficiently as could be done in a diploid species. The newly developed markers were uniformly distributed across the D genome and greatly extended the total coverage. Polymorphisms were surveyed in six varieties, and 31,542 polymorphic sites and 5,986 potential marker sites were detected in the D genome. The marker development and genotyping strategies are cost effective, robust and flexible and may enhance multi-sample studies in the post-genomic era in wheat.},

A total of 7982 ESTs that could be assembled into 5400 contigs and 2582 singletons were generated. Using the EST sequences that were obtained, 1973 primer pairs to amplify EST-derived SSR markers were designed and used for linkage analysis of 188 F1 progenies, which were generated by a cross between two Japanese plants, `273-7' and `T17-349,' with previously published SSR markers. An integrated linkage map was constructed by combining parentalspecific maps, which consisted of 1743 SSR loci on 16 homeologous linkage groups with a total length of 2511 cM. The primer sequences of the developed EST-SSR markers and their map positions are available on http://clovergarden.jp/. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed on 9 of 16 linkage groups of a parental-specific map. The genome structures were compared among white clover, red clover (T. pratense L.), Medicago truncatula, and Lotus japonicus. Macrosynteny was observed across the four legume species. Surprisingly, the comparative genome structure between white clover and M. truncatula had a higher degree of conservation than that of the two clover species.},

For several crop species, integrated consensus linkage maps that combine information from multiple mapping populations have been developed. For red clover, three genetic linkage maps have been published, but the information in these existing maps has not been integrated. Results: A consensus linkage map was constructed using six mapping populations originating from eight parental accessions. Three of the six mapping populations were established for this study. The integrated red clover map was composed of 1804 loci, including 1414 microsatellite loci, 181 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci and 204 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci, in seven linkage groups. The average distance between loci and the total length of the consensus map were 0.46 cM and 836.6 cM, respectively. The locus order on the consensus map correlated highly with that of accession-specific maps. Segregation distortion was observed across linkage groups. We investigated genome-wide allele frequency in 1144 red clover individuals using 462 microsatellite loci randomly chosen from the consensus map. The average number of alleles and polymorphism information content (PIC) were 9.17 and 0.69, respectively. Conclusion: A consensus genetic linkage map for red clover was constructed for the first time based on six mapping populations. The locus order on the consensus map was highly conserved among linkage maps and was sufficiently reliable for use as a reference for genetic analysis of random red clover germplasms.},

This prompted us to analyse conformation capture and recombination rate data to study the relationship between chromatin architecture and recombination landscape of human and mouse genomes. The results reveal that: (1) low recombination domains and blocks of elevated linkage disequilibrium tend to coincide with TADs and isochores, indicating co-evolving regulatory elements and genes in insulated neighbourhoods; (2) double strand break (DSB) and recombination frequencies increase in the short loops of GC-rich TADs, whereas recombination cold spots are typical of LADs and (3) the binding and loading of proteins, which are critical for DSB and meiotic recombination (SPO11, DMC1, H3K4me3 and PRMD9) are higher in GC-rich TADs. One explanation for these observations is that the occurrence of DSB and recombination in meiotic cells are associated with compositional and epigenetic features (genomic code) that influence DNA stiffness/flexibility and appear to be similar to those guiding the chromatin architecture in the interphase nucleus of pre-leptotene cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite its role as a generator of haplotypic variation, little is known about how the rates of recombination evolve across taxa. Recombination is a very labile force, susceptible to evolutionary and life trait related processes, which have also been correlated with general levels of genetic diversity. For example, in plants, it has been shown that long-lived outcrossing taxa, such as trees, have higher heterozygosity (He) at SSRs and allozymes than selfing or annual species. However, some of these tree taxa have surprisingly low levels of nucleotide diversity at the DNA sequence level, which points to recombination as a potential generator of genetic diversity in these organisms. In this study, we examine how genome-wide and within-gene rates of recombination evolve across plant taxa, determine whether such rates are influenced by the life-form adopted by species, and evaluate if higher genome-wide rates of recombination translate into higher He values, especially in trees. Results: Estimates of genome-wide (cM/Mb) recombination rates from 81 higher plants showed a significant phylogenetic signal. The use of different comparative phylogenetic models demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and He (0.83 {$\pm$} 0.29), and that trees have higher rates of genome-wide recombination than short-lived herbs and shrubs. A significant taxonomic component was further made evident by our models, as conifers exhibited lower recombination rates than angiosperms. This trend was also found at the within-gene level. Conclusions: Altogether, our results illustrate how both common ancestry and life-history traits have to be taken into account for understanding the evolution of genetic diversity and genomic rates of recombination across plant species, and highlight the relevance of species life forms to explain general levels of diversity and recombination.},

In this study, we examine how genome-wide and within-gene rates of recombination evolve across plant taxa, determine whether such rates are influenced by the life-form adopted by species, and evaluate if higher genome-wide rates of recombination translate into higher He values, especially in trees. Results: Estimates of genome-wide (cM/Mb) recombination rates from 81 higher plants showed a significant phylogenetic signal. The use of different comparative phylogenetic models demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and He (0.83 {$\pm$} 0.29), and that trees have higher rates of genome-wide recombination than short-lived herbs and shrubs. A significant taxonomic component was further made evident by our models, as conifers exhibited lower recombination rates than angiosperms. This trend was also found at the within-gene level. Conclusions: Altogether, our results illustrate how both common ancestry and life-history traits have to be taken into account for understanding the evolution of genetic diversity and genomic rates of recombination across plant species, and highlight the relevance of species life forms to explain general levels of diversity and recombination.},

Of all major taxonomic groups, land plants stand out due to their staggering genome size diversity, ranging ca. 2400-fold. As our understanding of the implications and significance of this remarkable genome size diversity in land plants grows, it is becoming increasingly evident that this trait plays not only an important role in shaping the evolution of plant genomes, but also in influencing plant community assemblages at the ecosystem level. Recent advances and improvements in novel sequencing technologies, as well as analytical tools, make it possible to gain critical insights into the genomic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning genome size changes. In this review we provide an overview of our current understanding of genome size diversity across the different land plant groups, its implications on the biology of the genome and what future directions need to be addressed to fill key knowledge gaps.},

  abstract = {The loss of recombination between sex chromosomes has occurred repeatedly throughout nature, with important implications for their subsequent evolution. Explanations for this remarkable convergence have generally invoked only adaptive processes (e.g. sexually antagonistic selection); however, there is still little evidence for these hypotheses. Here we propose a model in which recombination on sex chromosomes is lost due to the neutral accumulation of sequence divergence adjacent to (and thus, in linkage disequilibrium with) the sex determiner. Importantly, we include in our model the fact that sequence divergence, in any form, reduces the probability of recombination between any two sequences. Using simulations, we show that, under certain conditions, a region of suppressed recombination arises and expands outwards from the sex-determining locus, under purely neutral processes. Further, we show that the rate and pattern of recombination loss are sensitive to the pre-existing recombination landscape of the genome and to sex differences in recombination rates, with patterns consistent with evolutionary strata emerging under some conditions. We discuss the applicability of these results to natural systems.

This interval contained infrequently corrected palindromic markers 300 bp to the left and 600 bp to the right of the DSB hotspot. Conversion of single markers occurred frequently, while conversion of both markers occurred rarely, and many of the tetrads in which both markers converted were the products of multiple events. These data indicate that most meiotic recombination intermediates are asymmetrically positioned around the initiating DSB, with a short (\&lt;300 bp) tract of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) to one side and hDNA on the other side frequently extending 600 bp or more. One consequence of this asymmetry is the preferential concentration of crossovers in the vicinity of the initiating DSB.},

Results: Using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing, a genetic map composed of 6,434 loci, including 6,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 139 simple sequence repeat loci, was developed from RIL population.

We constructed a high-density genetic map based on whole-genome resequencing to identify loci associated with berry firmness. The genetic map had 19 linkage groups, including 1662 bin markers (26,039 SNPs), covering 1463.38 cM, and the average inter-marker distance was 0.88 cM. An analysis of berry firmness in the F1 population and both parents for three consecutive years revealed continuous variability in F1, with a distribution close to the normal distribution. Based on the genetic map and phenotypic data, three potentially significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to berry firmness were identified by composite interval mapping. The contribution rate of each QTL ranged from 21.5\% to 28.6\%. We identified four candidate genes associated with grape firmness, which are related to endoglucanase, abscisic acid (ABA), and transcription factors. A qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of abscisic-aldehyde oxidase-like gene (VIT\_18s0041g02410) and endoglucanase 3 gene (VIT\_18s0089g00210) in Muscat Hamburg was higher than in Crimson Seedless at the veraison stage, which was consistent with that of parent berry firmness. These results confirmed that VIT\_18s0041g02410 and VIT\_18s0089g00210 are candidate genes associated with berry firmness.},

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important tuber crop in the world, but research about meiotic recombination in potato is limited. Here, we resequenced 2,163 F2 clones derived from five different genetic backgrounds and identified 41,945 meiotic crossovers. Some recombination suppression in euchromatin regions was associated with large structural variants. We also detected five shared crossover hotspots. The number of crossovers in each F2 individual from the accession Upotato 1 varied from 9 to 27, with an average of 15.5, 78.25\% of which were mapped within 5 kb of their presumed location. We show that 57.1\% of the crossovers occurred in gene regions, with poly-A/T, poly-AG, AT-rich, and CCN repeats enriched in the crossover intervals. The recombination rate is positively related with gene density, SNP density, Class II transposon, and negatively related with GC density, repeat sequence density and Class I transposon. This study deepens our understanding of meiotic crossovers in potato and provides useful information for diploid potato breeding.},

However, aflatoxin contamination seriously affects the quality safety of peanut, hindering the development of peanut industry and threatening consumers' health. Breeding peanut varieties with resistance to             Aspergillus flavus             infection is important for control the aflatoxin contamination, and understanding of the genetic basis of resistance is vital to its genetic enhancement. In this study, we report the QTL mapping of resistance to             A. flavus             infection of a well-known resistant variety J11. A recombination inbred line (RIL) population was constructed by crossing a susceptible variety Zhonghua 16 and J11. Through whole-genome resequencing, a genetic linkage map was constructed with 2,802 recombination bins and an average inter-bin distance of 0.58 cM. Combined with phenotypic data of infection index in four consecutive years, six novel resistant QTLs were identified and they explained 5.03-10.87\% phenotypic variances. The favorable alleles of five QTLs were from J11 while that of one QTL were from Zhonghua 16. The pyramiding of these favorable alleles significantly improved the resistance to             A. flavus             infection. These results could contribute greatly to understanding of genetic basis of             A. flavus             resistance and could be meaningful in further resistance improvement in peanut.},

An F2 population of 140 individuals and their two parents were subjected to SLAF-seq. A total of 143.38 M pair-end reads were generated. The average sequencing depth was 26.51 in the maternal line (B214), 27.01 in the parental line (B227), and 5.11 in each F2 individual. When filtering low-depth SLAF tags, a total of 142,653 high-quality SLAFs were detected, and 22,151 of them were polymorphic, with a polymorphism rate of 15.42 \%. And finally, 4,607 of the polymorphic markers were selected for genetic map construction, and 12 linkage groups (LGs) were generated. The map spanned 2,172.86 cM with an average distance between adjacent markers for 0.49 cM. The inheritance of pericarp color was also studied, which showed that the pericarp color was controlled by one single gene. And based on the newly constructed high-density map, a single locus locating on chromosome 5 was identified for controlling the pericarp color of wax gourd. Conclusions: This is the first report of high-density genetic map construction and gene mapping in wax gourd, which will be served as an invaluable tool for gene mapping, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, comparative mapping and draft genome assembling of wax gourd.},

  abstract = {Mapping major quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for rice seed germinability under low temperature (GULT) can provide valuable genetic source for improving cold tolerance in rice breeding. In this study, 124 rice backcross recombinant inbred lines (BRILs) derived from a cross indica cv. Changhui 891 and japonica cv. 02428 were genotyped through re-sequencing technology. A bin map was generated which includes 3057 bins covering distance of 1266.5 cM with an average of 0.41 cM between markers. On the basis of newly constructed high-density genetic map, six QTL were detected ranging from 40 to 140 kb on Nipponbare genome. Among these, two QTL qCGR8 and qGRR11 alleles shared by 02428 could increase GULT and seed germination recovery rate after cold stress, respectively. However, qNGR1 and qNGR4 may be two major QTL affecting indica Changhui 891germination under normal condition. QTL qGRR1 and qGRR8 affected the seed germination recovery rate after cold stress and the alleles with increasing effects were shared by the Changhui 891 could improve seed germination rate after cold stress dramatically. These QTL could be a highly valuable genetic factors for cold tolerance improvement in rice lines. Moreover, the BRILs developed in this study will serve as an appropriate choice for mapping and studying genetic basis of rice complex traits.},

Errors in this process lead to negative health outcomes, while variability in recombination rate affects genome evolution. In mammals, most crossovers occur in hotspots defined by PRDM9 motifs, though PRDM9 binding sites are not all equally hot. We hypothesize that dynamic patterns of meiotic genome folding are linked to recombination activity.                                   Results             We apply an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze how three-dimensional (3D) chromosomal organization during meiosis relates to rates of double-strandbreak (DSB) and crossover formation at PRDM9 hotspots. We show that active, spatially accessible genomic regions during meiotic prophase are associated with DSB-favoured hotspots, which further adopt a transient locally active configuration in early prophase. Conversely, crossover formation is depleted among DSBs in spatially accessible regions during meiotic prophase, particularly within gene bodies. We also find evidence that active chromatin regions have smaller average loop sizes in mammalian meiosis. Collectively, these findings establish that differences in chromatin architecture along chromosomal axes are associated with variable recombination activity.                                   Conclusions             We propose an updated framework describing how 3D organization of brush-loop chromosomes during meiosis may modulate recombination.},

Understanding the causes of variation in recombination rate is important in interpreting and predicting evolutionary phenomena and in understanding the potential of a population to respond to selection. However, despite attention in model systems, there remains little data on how recombination rate varies at the individual level in natural populations. Here we used extensive pedigree and high-density SNP information in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to investigate the genetic architecture of individual autosomal recombination rates. Individual rates were high relative to other mammal systems and were higher in males than in females (autosomal map lengths of 3748 and 2860 cM, respectively). The heritability of autosomal recombination rate was low but significant in both sexes (h2 = 0.16 and 0.12 in females and males, respectively). In females, 46.7\% of the heritable variation was explained by a subtelomeric region on chromosome 6; a genome-wide association study showed the strongest associations at locus RNF212, with further associations observed at a nearby  374-kb region of complete LD containing three additional candidate loci, CPLX1, GAK, and PCGF3. A second region on chromosome 7 containing REC8 and RNF212B explained 26.2\% of the heritable variation in recombination rate in both sexes. Comparative analyses with 40 other sheep breeds showed that haplotypes associated with recombination rates are both old and globally distributed. Both regions have been implicated in rate variation in mice, cattle, and humans, suggesting a common genetic architecture of recombination rate variation in mammals.},

Here, we used information from the cattle genome and the 50 K Cervine Illumina BeadChip to inform and refine a high-density linkage map in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We constructed a predicted linkage map of 38,038 SNPs and a skeleton map of 10,835 SNPs across 34 linkage groups. We identified several chromosomal rearrangements in the deer lineage relative to sheep and cattle, including six chromosome fissions, one fusion, and two large inversions. Otherwise, our findings showed strong concordance with map orders in the cattle genome. The sex-averaged linkage map length was 2739.7 cM and the genome-wide autosomal recombination rate was 1.04 cM/Mb. The female autosomal map length was 1.21 longer than that of males (2767.4 cM vs. 2280.8 cM, respectively). Sex differences in map length were driven by high female recombination rates in peri-centromeric regions, a pattern that is unusual relative to other mammal species. This effect was more pronounced in fission chromosomes that would have had to produce new centromeres. We propose two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) that this mechanism may have evolved to counteract centromeric drive associated with meiotic asymmetry in oocyte production; and/or (2) that sequence and structural characteristics suppressing recombination in close proximity to the centromere may not have evolved at neo-centromeres. Our study provides insight into how recombination landscapes vary and evolve in mammals, and will provide a valuable resource for studies of evolution, genetic improvement, and population management in red deer and related species.},

We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the distribution of fitness effect as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.},

One of the most widespread polyphenisms in the flowering plants is cleistogamy, in which the same individual plant produces both open, cross-pollinated flowers as well as highly reduced and closed, self-pollinated (cleistogamous) flowers.1{\textendash}5 Cleistogamy is not a rare evolutionary phenomenon. It has evolved independently at least 41 times.1 But what favors the evolution of cleistogamy is still largely unknown.1 Darwin6 proposed a hypothesis that has never been properly tested. He observed that cleistogamy is more common in taxa with bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic) flowers than in those with radially symmetric (actinomorphic) flowers. Moreover, Darwin suggested that cleistogamous flowers help to ensure pollination, which he postulated is less certain in zygomorphic taxa that rely on more specialized groups of pollinators. Here, we combined the largest datasets on floral symmetry and cleistogamy and used phylogenetic approaches to show that cleistogamy is indeed disproportionately associated with zygomorphic flowers and that zygomorphic species are more likely to evolve cleistogamy than actinomorphic species. We also show that zygomorphic species are less capable of autonomous open-flower self-pollination (lower autofertility), suggesting that selection of cleistogamy via reproductive assurance in zygomorphic taxa could help account for Darwin's observation. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that polyphenisms are favored when organisms encounter contrasting environments.},

  abstract = {The question of recombination control has been the subject of intensive investigation over many years. This paper is restricted to an evaluation of the information obtainable from cytological studies of chiasmata, since other approaches are well represented in other papers in this volume. The advantages and disadvantages of chiasmata as means of studying recombination are discussed. Cytological observations reveal many constraints on the distribution of chiasmata, which are interpreted as outward expressions of controls operating at different levels, namely between cells, between bivalents and within bivalents. Detailed descriptions of these constraints are presented as a preliminary to discussing models and mechanisms of control. They include, at the between-bivalent level, over-dispersal of chiasma number per bivalent and the formation of an obligatory minimum of one chiasma per bivalent; and at the within-bivalent level, chiasma localization and chiasma interference. The genetical basis of these constraints is emphasized and evidence presented which suggests that chiasma distribution at different levels is subject to both separate and coordinate genetical controls. These observations lead to the consideration and evaluation of general stochastic models of chiasma control based on the modification of site probabilities for chiasma formation. While these models are a useful approach to thinking about the control of recombination, they do not give a fully satisfactory explanation of all aspects of chiasma control. Finally, specific mechanisms for chiasma distribution control are considered. In a few exceptional species, localized pairing and synaptonemal complexes lead to localized chiasma formation; details of two such cases are presented. In the majority of species, pairing is not localized or restricted and in these species the control of chiasma distribution is more conjectural. Arguments are presented which suggest that even in these cases of full pairing, the pattern of pairing initiation and progression and perhaps the timing of these events could be important factors controlling the distribution of chiasmata.},

Insight can be gained by comparing recombination rate variation across the genomes of related social and solitary insects. Here, we compare the genomic recombination landscape of the highly social honey bee, Apis mellifera, with the solitary alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, by analyzing patterns of linkage disequilibrium in population-scale genome sequencing data. We infer that average recombination rates are extremely elevated in A. mellifera compared with M. rotundata. However, our results indicate that similar factors control the distribution of crossovers in the genomes of both species. Recombination rate is significantly reduced in coding regions in both species, with genes inferred to be germline methylated having particularly low rates. Genes with worker-biased patterns of expression in A. mellifera and their orthologs in M. rotundata have higher than average recombination rates in both species, suggesting that selection for higher diversity in genes involved in worker caste functions in social taxa is not the explanation for these elevated rates. Furthermore, we find no evidence that recombination has modulated the efficacy of selection among genes during bee evolution, which does not support the hypothesis that high recombination rates facilitated positive selection for new functions in social insects. Our results indicate that the evolution of sociality in insects likely entailed selection on modifiers that increased recombination rates genome wide, but that the genomic recombination landscape is determined by the same factors.},

  abstract = {Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is a progenitor of all cultivated wheat grown today. It has been hypothesized that emmer was domesticated in the Karaca Dag{\textasciibreve} region in southeastern Turkey. A total of 445 recombinant inbred lines of T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. `Langdon' x wild emmer accession PI 428082 from this region was developed and genotyped with the Illumina 90K single nucleotide polymorphism Infinium assay. A genetic map comprising 2,650 segregating markers was constructed. The order of the segregating markers and an additional 8,264 cosegregating markers in the Aegilops tauschii reference genome sequence was used to compare synteny of the tetraploid wheat with the Brachypodium distachyon, rice, and sorghum. These comparisons revealed the presence of 15 structural chromosome rearrangements, in addition to the already known 4A-5A-7B rearrangements. The most common type was an intra-chromosomal translocation in which the translocated segment was short and was translocated only a short distance along the chromosome. A large reciprocal translocation, one small non-reciprocal translocation, and three large and one small paracentric inversions were also discovered. The use of inversions for a phylogeny reconstruction in the Triticum{\textendash}Aegilops alliance was illustrated. The genetic map was inconsistent with the current model of evolution of the rearranged chromosomes 4A-5A-7B. Genetic diversity in the rearranged chromosome 4A showed that the rearrangements might have been contemporary with wild emmer speciation. A selective sweep was found in the centromeric region of chromosome 4A in Karaca Dag{\textasciibreve} wild emmer but not in 4A of T. aestivum. The absence of diversity from a large portion of chromosome 4A of wild emmer, believed to be ancestral to all domesticated wheat, is puzzling.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Biologists have long sought to explain why we see genetic variation for traits in populations despite the expectation that selection will remove most variation. We address this question by using gene expression as a model trait and identifying the genetic loci that affect gene expression in a single, large population of the plant               Capsella grandiflora               . Alleles at loci that affect expression were rarer than expected under neutral expectations, and there was a negative correlation between phenotypic effect size and frequency of these alleles. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that purifying selection acts on the genetic variation for expression.                        ,                             The evolutionary forces that maintain genetic variation in quantitative traits within populations remain poorly understood. One hypothesis suggests that variation is under purifying selection, resulting in an excess of low-frequency variants and a negative correlation between minor allele frequency and selection coefficients. Here, we test these predictions using the genetic loci associated with total expression variation (eQTLs) and allele-specific expression variation (aseQTLs) mapped within a single population of the plant               Capsella grandiflora               . In addition to finding eQTLs and aseQTLs for a large fraction of genes, we show that alleles at these loci are rarer than expected and exhibit a negative correlation between phenotypic effect size and frequency. Overall, our results show that the distribution of frequencies and effect sizes of the loci responsible for local expression variation within a single outcrossing population are consistent with the effects of purifying selection.},

Genetical genomics or the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping method and key findings in this research are reviewed. Various procedures and potential uses of eQTL mapping, global linkage clustering, and systems genetics are illustrated using actual analysis on recombinant inbred lines of mice with data on gene expression (for diabetes- and obesity-related genes), pathway, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage maps. Experimental and bioinformatics difficulties and possible solutions are discussed. The main uses of this systems genetics approach in quantitative genomics were shown to be in refinement of the identified QTL, candidate gene and SNP discovery, understanding gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, detection of candidate regulator genes/eQTL, discriminating multiple QTL/eQTL, and detection of pleiotropic QTL/eQTL, in addition to its use in reconstructing regulatory networks. The potential uses in animal breeding are direct selection on heritable gene expression measures, termed "expression assisted selection," and genetical genomic selection of both QTL and eQTL based on breeding values of the respective genes, termed "expression-assisted evaluation."},

Oat has a low carbon footprint, substantial health benefits and the potential to replace animal-based food products. However, the lack of a fully annotated reference genome has hampered efforts to deconvolute its complex evolutionary history and functional gene dynamics. Here we present a high-quality reference genome of               A               .               sativa               and close relatives of its diploid (               Avena longiglumis               , AA, 2               n               \,=\,14) and tetraploid (               Avena insularis               , CCDD, 2               n               \,=\,4               x               \,=\,28) progenitors. We reveal the mosaic structure of the oat genome, trace large-scale genomic reorganizations in the polyploidization history of oat and illustrate a breeding barrier associated with the genome architecture of oat. We showcase detailed analyses of gene families implicated in human health and nutrition, which adds to the evidence supporting oat safety in gluten-free diets, and we perform mapping-by-sequencing of an agronomic trait related to water-use efficiency. This resource for the               Avena               genus will help to leverage knowledge from other cereal genomes, improve understanding of basic oat biology and accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and reanalysis of quantitative trait studies.},

  abstract = {Two-locus sampling probabilities have played a central role in devising an efficient composite-likelihood method for estimating fine-scale recombination rates. Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling probabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a constant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting recombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of historical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here new methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size functions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented in a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling probability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but sparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes (n \# 50) and demographic size histories with a large number of epochs (D \$ 64). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling probability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size (n \$ 256). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior distribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal proposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study how a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the correlation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive simulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under such a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale recombination rate estimation.},

Spruce (                 Picea                 ) genomics work is quite challenging, mainly because of extremely large size and highly repetitive nature of its genome, unsequenced and poorly understood genome, and the general lack of advanced-generation pedigrees. Our goal was to construct a high-density genetic linkage map of black spruce (                 Picea mariana                 , 2n = 24), which is a predominant, transcontinental species of the North American boreal and temperate forests, with high ecological and economic importance.                                                        Results                                We have developed a near-saturated and complete genetic linkage map of black spruce using a three-generation outbred pedigree and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), selectively amplified microsatellite polymorphic loci (SAMPL), expressed sequence tag polymorphism (ESTP), and microsatellite (mostly cDNA based) markers. Maternal, paternal, and consensus genetic linkage maps were constructed. The maternal, paternal, and consensus maps in our study consistently coalesced into 12 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number (1n = 1x = 12) of 12 in the genus                 Picea                 . The maternal map had 816 and the paternal map 743 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups each. The consensus map consisted of 1,111 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups, and covered almost the entire ({$>$} 97\%) black spruce genome. The mapped markers included 809 AFLPs, 255 SAMPL, 42 microsatellites, and 5 ESTPs. Total estimated length of the genetic map was 1,770 cM, with an average of one marker every 1.6 cM. The maternal, paternal and consensus genetic maps aligned almost perfectly.                                                        Conclusion                                We have constructed the first high density to near-saturated genetic linkage map of black spruce, with greater than 97\% genome coverage. Also, this is the first genetic map based on a three-generation outbred pedigree in the genus                 Picea                 . The genome length in                 P. mariana                 is likely to be about 1,800 cM.

Our goal was to construct a high-density genetic linkage map of black spruce (Picea mariana, 2n = 24), which is a predominant, transcontinental species of the North American boreal and temperate forests, with high ecological and economic importance. Results: We have developed a near-saturated and complete genetic linkage map of black spruce using a threegeneration outbred pedigree and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), selectively amplified microsatellite polymorphic loci (SAMPL), expressed sequence tag polymorphism (ESTP), and microsatellite (mostly cDNA based) markers. Maternal, paternal, and consensus genetic linkage maps were constructed. The maternal, paternal, and consensus maps in our study consistently coalesced into 12 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number (1n = 1x = 12) of 12 in the genus Picea. The maternal map had 816 and the paternal map 743 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups each. The consensus map consisted of 1,111 markers distributed over 12 linkage groups, and covered almost the entire ({$>$}97\%) black spruce genome. The mapped markers included 809 AFLPs, 255 SAMPL, 42 microsatellites, and 5 ESTPs. Total estimated length of the genetic map was 1,770 cM, with an average of one marker every 1.6 cM. The maternal, paternal and consensus genetic maps aligned almost perfectly. Conclusion: We have constructed the first high density to near-saturated genetic linkage map of black spruce, with greater than 97\% genome coverage. Also, this is the first genetic map based on a three-generation outbred pedigree in the genus Picea. The genome length in P. mariana is likely to be about 1,800 cM. The genetic maps developed in our study can serve as a reference map for various genomics studies and applications in Picea and Pinaceae.},

  abstract = {In fission yeast and other eukaryotes, Rec12 (Spo11) is thought to catalyze the formation of dsDNA breaks (DSBs) that initiate homologous recombination in meiosis. Rec12 is orthologous to the catalytic subunit of topoisomerase VI (Top6A). Guided by the crystal structure of Top6A, we engineered the rec12 locus to encode Rec12 proteins each with a single amino acid substitution in a conserved residue. Of 21 substitutions, 10 significantly reduced or abolished meiotic DSBs, gene conversion, crossover recombination and the faithful segregation of chromosomes. Critical residues map within the metal ion-binding pocket toprim (E179A, D229A, D231A), catalytic region 5Y-CAP (R94A, D95A, Y98F) and the DNA-binding interface (K201A, G202E, R209A, K242A). A subset of substitutions reduced DSBs but maintained crossovers, demonstrating crossover homeostasis. Furthermore, a strong separation of function mutation (R304A) suggests that the crossover/ non-crossover decision is established early by a protein{\textendash}protein interaction surface of Rec12. Fission yeast has multiple crossovers per bivalent, and chromosome segregation was robust above a threshold of about one crossover per bivalent, below which non-disjunction occurred. These results support structural and functional conservation among Rec12/Spo11/Top6A family members for the catalysis of DSBs, and they reveal how Rec12 regulates other features of meiotic chromosome dynamics.},

The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

  abstract = {Understanding the distribution of sites at which replication forks stall, and the ensuing fork processing events, requires genome-wide methods sensitive to both changes in replication fork structure and the formation of recombinogenic DNA ends. Here we describe Transferase-Activated End Ligation sequencing (TrAEL-seq), a method that captures single stranded DNA 3' ends genome-wide and with base pair resolution. TrAEL-seq labels DNA breaks, and profiles both stalled and processive replication forks in yeast and mammalian cells. Replication forks stalling at defined barriers and expressed genes are detected by TrAEL-seq with exceptional signal-to-noise, most likely through labelling of DNA 3' ends exposed during fork reversal. TrAEL-seq also labels unperturbed processive replication forks to yield maps of replication fork direction similar to those obtained by Okazaki fragment sequencing, however TrAEL-seq is performed on asynchronous populations of wild-type cells without incorporation of labels, cell sorting, or biochemical purification of replication intermediates, rendering TrAEL-seq simpler and more widely applicable than existing replication fork direction profiling methods. The specificity of TrAEL-seq for DNA 3' ends also allows accurate detection of double strand break sites after the initiation of DNA end resection, which we demonstrate by genome-wide mapping of meiotic double strand break hotspots in a dmc1{$\Delta$} mutant. Overall, TrAEL-seq provides a flexible and robust methodology with high sensitivity and resolution for studying DNA replication and repair, which will be of significant use in determining mechanisms of genome instability.},

To better document the prevalence of selection at linked sites, we used new and published whole-genome sequences to survey nucleotide variation in population samples of the western European house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) from Germany, France, and Gough Island, a remote volcanic island in the south Atlantic. Correlations between sequence variation and recombination rates estimated independently from dense linkage maps were consistently very weak (q 0.06), though they exceeded conventional significance thresholds. This pattern persisted in comparisons between genomic regions with the highest and lowest recombination rates, as well as in models incorporating the density of transcribed sites, the density of CpG dinucleotides, and divergence between mouse and rat as covariates. We conclude that natural selection affects linked neutral variation in a restricted manner in the western European house mouse.},

The map consists of 264 markers, including sequence-tagged sites (STS), scored by use of PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, and restriction fragment length polymorphism markers, scored by use of Southern blot hybridization. All molecular markers tested map to one of the 17 known linkage groups of               C. reinhardtii               . The map covers approximately 1,000 centimorgans (cM). Any position on the               C. reinhardtii               genetic map is, on average, within 2 cM of a mapped molecular marker. This molecular map, in combination with the ongoing mapping of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and the forthcoming sequence of the               C. reinhardtii               nuclear genome, should greatly facilitate isolation of genes of interest by using positional cloning methods. In addition, the presence of easily assayed STS markers on each arm of each linkage group should be very useful in mapping new mutations in preparation for positional cloning.},

In our map, genes from all 10 A. thaliana chromosome arms are also tightly linked in A. lyrata. Genes from the regions on the two sides of CEN5 have distant map localizations in A. lyrata (genes on the A. thaliana short-arm genes are on linkage group AL6, and long-arm genes are on AL7), but genes from the other four A. thaliana centromere regions remain closely linked in A. lyrata. The observation of complete linkage between short- and long-arm centromere genes, but not between genes in other genome regions that are separated by similar physical distances, suggests that crossing-over frequencies near the A. lyrata ssp. petraea centromere regions are low, as in A. thaliana. Thus, the centromere positions appear to be conserved between A. thaliana and A. lyrata, even though three centromeres have been lost in A. thaliana, and the core satellite sequences in the two species are very different. We can now definitively identify the three centromeres that were eliminated in the fusions that formed the A. thaliana chromosomes. However, we cannot tell whether genes were lost along with these centromeres, because such genes are absent from the A. thaliana genome, which is the sole source of markers for our mapping.},

Several methods are available for studying chromosome architecture, each with different strengths and limitations. Established imaging approaches and proximity ligation-b ased chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques (such as DNA-F ISH and Hi-C , respectively) have revealed the existence of chromosome territories, functional nuclear landmarks (such as splicing speckles and the nuclear lamina) and topologically associating domains. Improvements to these methods and the recent development of ligation-free approaches, including GAM, SPRITE and ChIA-D rop, are now helping to uncover new aspects of 3D genome topology that confirm the nucleus to be a complex, highly organized organelle.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing allow population-genomic data to be generated for virtually any species. However, approaches to analyse such data lag behind the ability to generate it, particularly in nonmodel species. Linkage disequilibrium (LD, the nonrandom association of alleles from different loci) is a highly sensitive indicator of many evolutionary phenomena including chromosomal inversions, local adaptation and geographical structure. Here, we present linkage disequilibrium network analysis (LDna), which accesses information on LD shared between multiple loci genomewide. In LD networks, vertices represent loci, and connections between vertices represent the LD between them. We analysed such networks in two test cases: a new restriction-site-associated DNA sequence (RADseq) data set for Anopheles baimaii, a Southeast Asian malaria vector; and a well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set from 21 three-spined stickleback individuals. In each case, we readily identified five distinct LD network clusters (single-outlier clusters, SOCs), each comprising many loci connected by high LD. In A. baimaii, further population-genetic analyses supported the inference that each SOC corresponds to a large inversion, consistent with previous cytological studies. For sticklebacks, we inferred that each SOC was associated with a distinct evolutionary phenomenon: two chromosomal inversions, local adaptation, population-demographic history and geographic structure. LDna is thus a useful exploratory tool, able to give a global overview of LD associated with diverse evolutionary phenomena and identify loci potentially involved. LDna does not require a linkage map or reference genome, so it is applicable to any population-genomic data set, making it especially valuable for nonmodel species.},

Our popGenHMM assumes that SNP frequencies are emitted independently following diffusion approximation expectations but that neighboring SNP frequencies are partially correlated by selective state. We give results from the training and application of our popGenHMM to a set of early release data from the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (dpgp.org) that consists of approximately 7.8 Mb of resequencing from 32 North American Drosophila melanogaster lines. These results demonstrate the potential utility of our model, making predictions based on the site frequency spectrum (SFS) for regions of the genome that represent selected elements.},

The present study exploited genome assemblies of the Brassica diploids,               Brassica nigra               and               Brassica oleracea,               to discover over 10,000 genome-wide SNPs using genotype by sequencing of 620               B. carinata               lines. The analyses revealed a SNP frequency of one every 91.7~kb, a heterozygosity level of 0.30, nucleotide diversity levels of 1.31\,{\texttimes}\,10               -05               , and the first five principal components captured only 13\% molecular variation, indicating low levels of genetic diversity among the               B. carinata               collection. Genome bias was observed, with greater SNP density found on the B subgenome. The 620 lines clustered into two distinct sub-populations (SP1 and SP2) with the majority of accessions (88\%) clustered in SP1 with those from Ethiopia, the presumed centre of origin. SP2 was distinguished by a collection of breeding lines, implicating targeted selection in creating population structure. Two selective sweep regions on B3 and B8 were detected, which harbour genes involved in fatty acid and aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, respectively. The assessment of genetic diversity, population structure, and LD in the global               B. carinata               collection provides critical information to assist future crop improvement.},

  abstract = {Integrated mapping in large-genome monocots has been carried out on a limited number of species. Furthermore, integrated maps are difficult to construct for these species due to, among other reasons, the specific plant populations needed. To fill these gaps, Alliums were chosen as target species and a new strategy for constructing suitable populations was developed. This strategy involves the use of trihybrid genotypes in which only one homeolog of a chromosome pair is recombinant due to interspecific recombination. We used genotypes from a trihybrid Allium cepa œ´ (A. roylei œ´ A. fistulosum) population. Recombinant chromosomes 5 and 8 from the interspecific parent were analyzed using genomic in situ hybridization visualization of recombination points and the physical positions of recombination were integrated into AFLP linkage maps of both chromosomes. The integrated maps showed that in Alliums recombination predominantly occurs in the proximal half of chromosome arms and that 57.9\% of Pst I/Mse I markers are located in close proximity to the centromeric region, suggesting the presence of genes in this region. These findings are different from data obtained on cereals, where recombination rate and gene density tends to be higher in distal regions.},

However, this strategy is impeded by the difficulty of conducting meaningful statistical analysis using noisy biological data. A recent study suggested that the partial correlation analysis is misleading when data is noisy and that the principal component regression analysis is a better tool to analyze biological data. In this paper, we evaluate how these two statistical tools (partial correlation and principal component regression) perform when data are noisy. Contrary to the earlier conclusion, we found that these two tools perform comparably in most cases. Furthermore, when there is more than one `true' independent variable, partial correlation analysis delivers a better representation of the data. Employing both tools may provide a more complete and complementary representation of the real data. In this light, and with new analyses, we suggest that protein length and gene dispensability play significant, independent roles in yeast protein evolution.},

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oilseed crop that has great potential to provide sustainable feedstock for biofuel production and to improve dryland agriculture. A major breeding objective for camelina is to increase seed size and oil content. Understanding the genetics behind variations of seed size and associated traits such as oil content would help breeders develop varieties of increased oil yield that are more robust, easier to plant and harvest, and better for oil processing. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred population derived from the two camelina accessions, Suneson and Pryzeth, with contrasting traits, especially seed size and oil content. Using 189 lines, a genetic map was constructed containing 2376 single nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 2034.6 cM of 20 linkage groups with an average density of 1.5 cM per locus. Field trials were conducted for 2 years (2017 and 2018) in two environments (dryland and irrigated) in Bozeman, Montana. The results revealed important correlations of seed size with other associated traits such as oil content, pod size and seed number per pod. Significant QTLs were also discovered for these traits. The results of this study are the first step to isolate genes controlling seed development and oil accumulation and to develop advanced varieties of camelina better adapted to modern agriculture by marker-assisted breeding.},

  abstract = {Annotating coding genes and inferring orthologs are two classical challenges in genomics and evolutionary biology that have traditionally been approached separately, limiting scalability. We present TOGA (Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments), a method that integrates structural gene annotation and orthology inference. TOGA implements a different paradigm to infer orthologous loci, improves ortholog detection and annotation of conserved genes compared with state-of-the-art methods, and handles even highly fragmented assemblies. TOGA scales to hundreds of genomes, which we demonstrate by applying it to 488 placental mammal and 501 bird assemblies, creating the largest comparative gene resources so far. Additionally, TOGA detects gene losses, enables selection screens, and automatically provides a superior measure of mammalian genome quality. TOGA is a powerful and scalable method to annotate and compare genes in the genomic era.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Comparative genomics provides valuable insights into gene function, phylogeny, molecular evolution, and associations between phenotypic and genomic differences. Such analyses require knowledge about which genes originated from a speciation event (orthologs) or from a duplication event (paralogs). Existing methods to detect orthologs in turn require knowledge of the location of genes in the genome (gene annotation), which is itself a challenging problem, resulting in a growing gap between sequenced and annotated genomes.                                         RATIONALE               We developed TOGA (Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments), a genomics method that integrates orthology inference and gene annotation. TOGA takes as input a gene annotation of a reference species (e.g., human, mouse, or chicken) and a whole-genome alignment between the reference and a query genome (e.g., other mammals or birds). It infers orthologous gene loci in the query genome, annotates and classifies orthologous genes, detects gene losses and duplications, and generates protein and codon alignments.               Orthology detection relies on the principle that orthologous sequences are generally more similar to each other than to paralogous sequences. Whereas existing methods work with annotated protein-coding sequences, TOGA extends this similarity principle to non-exonic regions (introns and intergenic regions) and uses machine learning to detect orthologous gene loci based on alignments of intronic and intergenic regions.                                         RESULTS               We demonstrate that TOGA's machine learning classifier detects orthologous gene loci with a very high accuracy, and also works for orthologous genes that underwent translocations or inversions. TOGA improves ortholog detection and comprehensively annotates conserved genes, even if transcriptomics data are available. Although homology-based methods such as TOGA cannot annotate orthologs of genes that are not present in the reference, we show that reference bias can be effectively counteracted by integrating annotations generated with multiple reference species. TOGA can also be applied to highly fragmented genome assemblies, where genes are often split across scaffolds. By accurately identifying and joining orthologous gene fragments, TOGA annotates entire genes and thus increases the utility of fragmented genomes for comparative analyses. TOGA's gene classification explicitly distinguishes between genes with missing sequences (indicative of assembly incompleteness) and genes with inactivating mutations (potentially indicative of base errors). We show that this classification provides a superior benchmark for assembly completeness and quality.               As genomes are generated at an increasing rate, annotation and orthology inference methods that can handle hundreds or thousands of genomes are needed. TOGA's reference species methodology scales linearly with the number of query species. By applying TOGA with human and mouse as references to 488 placental mammal assemblies and using chicken as a reference for 501 bird assemblies, we created large comparative resources for mammals and birds that comprise gene annotations, ortholog sets, lists of inactivated genes, and multiple codon alignments.                                         CONCLUSION               TOGA provides a general strategy to cope with the annotation and orthology inference bottleneck. We envision three major uses. First, TOGA enables phylogenomic analyses of orthologous genes and screens for gene changes (e.g., selection, loss, and duplication) that are associated with phenotypic differences. Second, TOGA provides annotations of genes that are conserved in newly sequenced genomes, which can be supplemented with transcriptomics data to detect lineage-specific genes or exons. Finally, TOGA's gene classification provides a powerful genome assembly quality benchmark.                                                   A different paradigm for orthology inference.                   Orthologous, but not paralogous, genes have partially aligning intronic and intergenic regions. TOGA uses this principle to infer orthologous gene loci and integrates orthology inference with gene annotation. Using a reference species, TOGA can be applied to hundreds of aligned query genomes to provide rich comparative genomics resources.},

Wang and J. D. Griffith, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8863{\textendash}8867, 1996). To determine the in vivo effects of these sequences, we replaced the upstream regulatory sequences of the               HIS4               gene of               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               with either 12 or 48 tandem copies of CCGNN. Both tracts activated               HIS4               transcription. We found that (CCGNN)               12               tracts elevated meiotic recombination (hot spot activity), whereas the (CCGNN)               48               tract repressed recombination (cold spot activity). In addition, a ``pure'' tract of (CCGAT)               12               activated both transcription and meiotic recombination. We suggest that the cold spot activity of the (CCGNN)               48               tract is related to the phenomenon of the suppressive interactions of adjacent hot spots previously described in yeast (Q.-Q.

We explore the ways in which eukaryotic genomes have evolved defense mechanisms to temper TE activity and the ways in which TEs continue to influence genome structure despite being rendered transpositionally inactive. Finally, we focus on the role of TEs in the establishment, maintenance, and stabilization of critical, yet rapidly evolving, chromosome features: eukaryotic centromeres. Across centromeres, specific types of TEs participate in genomic conflict, a balancing act wherein they are actively inserting into centromeric domains yet are harnessed for the recruitment of centromeric histones and potentially new centromere formation.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Many effects attributed to recombination have been invoked to explain the advantage of sex. The most prominent arguments focus on either evolvability, genetic diversity, or mutational robustness to justify why the benefit of recombination overcomes its costs, with partially contradicting results. As a consequence, understanding which aspects of recombination are most important in a given situation remains an open problem for theoretical and experimental research. In this study, we focus on finite populations evolving on neutral networks, which already display remarkably complex behavior. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of recombination by jointly considering different measures of evolvability, genetic diversity, and mutational robustness over a broad parameter range, such that many evolutionary regimes are covered. We find that several of these measures vary non-monotonically with the rates of mutation and recombination. Moreover, the presence of lethal genotypes that introduce inhomogeneities in the network of viable states qualitatively alters the effects of recombination. We conclude that conflicting trends induced by recombination can be explained by an emerging trade-off between evolvability and genetic diversity on the one hand, and mutational robustness and fitness on the other. Finally, we discuss how different implementations of the recombination scheme in theoretical models can affect the observed dependence on recombination rate through a coupling between recombination and genetic drift.},

Here we compare F2 and RI maps derived from a cross between the same two parental lines and show that excess heterozygosity contributes to map inflation. These maps have been constructed using a common set of dominant markers. Although not generally regarded as informative for F2 mapping, these allowed rapid map construction, and the resulting data analysis has provided information not otherwise obvious when examining a population from only one generation. Segregation distortion, a common feature of most populations and marker systems, found in the F2 but not the RI, has identified excess heterozygosity. A few markers with a deficiency of heterozygotes were found to map to linkage group V (chromosome 3), which is known to form rod bivalents in this cross. Although the final map length was longer for the F2 population, the mapped order of markers was generally the same in the F2 and RI maps. The data presented in this analysis reconcile much of the inconsistency between map length estimates from chiasma counts and genetic data.},

  abstract = {Genetic drift is expected to remove polymorphism from populations over long periods of time, with the rate of polymorphism loss being accelerated when species experience strong reductions in population size. Adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation in populations, or balancing selection, might counteract this process. To understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity, we document genomic variability after two parallel species-wide bottlenecks in the genus Capsella. We find that ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci, and that the same collection of alleles has been maintained in different lineages that have been separated for several million years. By reconstructing the evolution of the disease-related locus MLO2b, we find that divergence between ancient haplotypes can be obscured by referenced based re-sequencing methods, and that trans-specific alleles can encode substantially diverged protein sequences. Our data point to long-term balancing selection as an important factor shaping the genetics of immune systems in plants and as the predominant driver of genomic variability after a population bottleneck.           ,              Capsella rubella is a small plant that is found in southern and western Europe. This plant is young in evolutionary terms: it is thought to have emerged less than 200,000 years ago from a small group of plants belonging to an older species known as Capsella grandiflora.             Individuals of the same species may carry alternative versions of the same genes {\textendash} known as alleles {\textendash} and the total number of alleles present in a population is referred to as genetic diversity. When a few individuals form a new species, the gene pool and the genetic diversity in the new species is initially much lower than in the ancestral species, which may make the new species less robust to fluctuations in the environment. For example, alternative versions of a gene might be preferable in hot or cold climates, and loss of one of these versions would limit the species' ability to survive in both climates.             A mechanism known as balancing selection can maintain various alleles in a species, even if the population is very small. However, it was not clear how common long-lasting balancing selection was after a species had split. To address this question, Koenig et al. assembled collections of wild C. rubella and C. grandiflora plants and sequenced their genomes in search of alleles that were shared between individuals of the two species.             The analysis found not just a few, but thousands of examples where the same genetic differences had been maintained in both C. rubella and C. grandiflora. Some of these allele pairs were also shared with individuals of a third species of Capsella that had split from C. rubella and C. grandiflora over a million years ago. The shared alleles did not occur randomly in the genome; genes involved in immune responses were far more likely to be targets of balancing selection than other types of genes.             These findings indicate that there is strong balancing selection to maintain different alleles of immunity genes in wild populations of plants, and that some of this diversity can be maintained over hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. The strategy developed by Koenig et al. may help to identify new versions of immunity genes from wild relatives of crop plants that could be used to combat crop diseases.},

Recent studies that identify some of these proteins reinforce and expand the model of two meiotic crossover pathways.

  abstract = {Background: Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) has the potential to be a broadly applicable, low-cost approach for high-quality genetic linkage mapping in forest trees lacking a reference genome. The statistical inference of linear order must be as accurate as possible for the correct ordering of sequence scaffolds and contigs to chromosomal locations. Accurate maps also facilitate the discovery of chromosome segments containing allelic variants conferring resistance to the biotic and abiotic stresses that threaten forest trees worldwide. We used ddRADseq for genetic mapping in the tree Quercus rubra, with an approach optimized to produce a high-quality map. Our study design also enabled us to model the results we would have obtained with less depth of coverage. Results: Our sequencing design produced a high sequencing depth in the parents (248{\texttimes}) and a moderate sequencing depth (15{\texttimes}) in the progeny. The digital normalization method of generating a de novo reference and the SAMtools SNP variant caller yielded the most SNP calls (78,725). The major drivers of map inflation were multiple SNPs located within the same sequence (77\% of SNPs called). The highest quality map was generated with a low level of missing data (5\%) and a genome-wide threshold of 0.025 for deviation from Mendelian expectation. The final map included 849 SNP markers (1. 8\% of the 78,725 SNPs called). Downsampling the individual FASTQ files to model lower depth of coverage revealed that sequencing the progeny using 96 samples per lane would have yielded too few SNP markers to generate a map, even if we had sequenced the parents at depth 248{\texttimes}. Conclusions: The ddRADseq technology produced enough high-quality SNP markers to make a moderately dense, high-quality map. The success of this project was due to high depth of coverage of the parents, moderate depth of coverage of the progeny, a good framework map, an optimized bioinformatics pipeline, and rigorous premapping filters. The ddRADseq approach is useful for the construction of high-quality genetic maps in organisms lacking a reference genome if the parents and progeny are sequenced at sufficient depth. Technical improvements in reduced representation sequencing (RRS) approaches are needed to reduce the amount of missing data.},

  abstract = {A central goal in evolutionary genetics is to understand the forces that drive patterns of nucleotide variation within species. Recombination rate and nucleotide diversity are positively correlated across loci within many species. Selective sweeps and background selection both may contribute to this pattern by reducing nucleotide variation disproportionately in regions of low recombination. While there is unambiguous documentation of some forms of selective sweeps, it is less clear how much background selection and soft selective sweeps contribute. Here, we discuss the study of these different types of linked selection, paying particular attention to the large body of work devoted to linked selection in Drosophila. We discuss patterns of nucleotide variation in the classic model system Drosophila pseudoobscura, and we leverage this system to test for the effects of linked selection in the near absence of hard, complete selective sweeps. Our case study of variation in sets of loci shared between Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. miranda suggests that selection at linked sites may reduce nucleotide variation even in the absence of hard selective sweeps. We discuss how this work relates to recent approaches and challenges in the study of how selection at linked sites influences patterns of nucleotide variation.},

  abstract = {Crossing over is well known to have profound effects on patterns of genetic diversity and genome evolution. Far less direct attention has been paid to another distinct outcome of meiotic recombination: non-crossover gene conversion. Crossing over and non-crossover gene conversion both shuffle combinations of alleles, and this degradation of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) has major evolutionary consequences, ranging from immediate effects on nucleotide diversity to long-term consequences that shape genome evolution, species formation, and species persistence. Unlike simple crossing over, non-crossover gene conversion has the potential to alter allele frequencies. Gene conversion can also occur in genomic regions where crossing over does not, and it purportedly exhibits more uniform rates across genomes. Considerable progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms of gene conversion, and this progress enables us to begin exploring how gene conversion affects processes such as molecular evolution and interspecies gene flow. These topics are timely with the recent shift in focus from a primarily neutral null model of molecular evolution and speciation to one incorporating base levels of selection, making it all the more crucial to understand the basis and evolutionary implications of linkage. Here, we discuss the impact of gene conversion on genome structure and evolution, and the current methods for detecting these events. We provide a comprehensive review of how gene conversion breaks down LD and affects both short- and long-term evolutionary processes, and we contrast its impact to that expected from crossing over alone.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Suppressed recombination in chromosomal inversion heterozygotes is a well-known but poorly understood phenomenon. Recombination suppression is the result of at least four different regional effects of inversion heterozygosity; surprisingly, this includes areas outside inversions where there are no barriers to normal pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation, or recovery of crossover products. The interference hypothesis of recombination suppression proposes heterozygous inversion breakpoints possess chiasma-like properties such that recombination suppression extends from breakpoints in a process analogous to crossover interference. This hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with chromosome-wide patterns of recombination suppression, unifying the various regional effects under a single mechanism. The present study generates quantitative predictions for this hypothesis using a probabilistic model of crossover interference as a stationary renewal point process with gamma-distributed interarrival distances. These predictions were tested with formal genetic data ({$>$}40,000 meioses) on crossing-over in intervals external and adjacent to four cosmopolitan inversions of             Drosophila melanogaster             . The decay of recombination suppression differs for each of the four cosmopolitan inversions, with a strong dependence on proximity to the centromere. Counterintuitively, greater than expected recombination was observed in centromeric regions for the most proximally placed inversions. Structural features of chromosomes are discussed as potentially confounding variables in modelling recombination suppression. The true form of the decay function is not currently known and will require high-resolution mapping of rare crossover events in regions immediately adjacent to inversion breakpoints. A simple extension of the present experimental system can be conducted as a genetic screen for those rare crossover events.},

  abstract = {Background: Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) is an important crop of temperate climate zones, which provides nearly 30 \% of the world's annual sugar needs. From the total genome size of 758 Mb, only 567 Mb were incorporated in the recently published genome sequence, due to the fact that regions with high repetitive DNA contents (e.g. satellite DNAs) are only partially included. Therefore, to fill these gaps and to gain information about the repeat composition of centromeres and heterochromatic regions, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) using antibodies against the centromere-specific histone H3 variant of sugar beet (CenH3) and the heterochromatic mark of dimethylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2). Results: ChIP-Seq analysis revealed that active centromeres containing CenH3 consist of the satellite pBV and the Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon Beetle7, while heterochromatin marked by H3K9me2 exhibits heterogeneity in repeat composition. H3K9me2 was mainly associated with the satellite family pEV, the Ty1-copia retrotransposon family Cotzilla and the DNA transposon superfamily of the En/Spm type. In members of the section Beta within the genus Beta, immunostaining using the CenH3 antibody was successful, indicating that orthologous CenH3 proteins are present in closely related species within this section. Conclusions: The identification of repetitive genome portions by ChIP-Seq experiments complemented the sugar beet reference sequence by providing insights into the repeat composition of poorly characterized CenH3-chromatin and H3K9me2-heterochromatin. Therefore, our work provides the basis for future research and application concerning the sugar beet centromere and repeat-rich heterochromatic regions characterized by the presence of H3K9me2.},

A new map was constructed based on DArTseq markers{\textemdash}a new type of marker generated with the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique. The map was built with 4602 markers, which are divided into 20 linkage groups, corresponding with the number of gametic chromosomes in narrow-leafed lupin. On the new map there are 1174 unique loci. The total length of all linkage group is 3042 cM. This map was compared to the reference genome of narrow-leafed lupin and the CDS sequence for model legume species: emphMedicago truncatula, emphLotus japonicus and Glycine max. Analysis revealed the presence of the DArTseq marker common for all investigated species. We were able to map 38 new, unplaced scaffolds on the new genetic map of narrow-leafed lupin.

Here, we study the coexpression and interspecies conservation of divergent and convergent gene pairs in three plant species: rice (Oryza sativa), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Strongly correlated expression levels between divergent and convergent genes were found to be quite common in all three species, and the frequency of strong correlation appears to be independent of intergenic distance. Conservation of divergent or convergent arrangement among these species appears to be quite rare. However, conserved arrangement is significantly more frequent when the genes display strongly correlated expression levels or have one or more Gene Ontology (GO) classes in common. A correlation between intergenic distance in divergent and convergent gene pairs and shared GO classes was observed, in varying degrees, in rice and Populus but not in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, multiple GO classes were either overrepresented or underrepresented in Arabidopsis and Populus gene pairs, while only two GO classes were underrepresented in rice divergent gene pairs. Three cis-regulatory elements common to both Arabidopsis and rice were overrepresented in the intergenic regions of strongly correlated divergent gene pairs compared to those of noncorrelated pairs. Our results suggest that shared as well as unique mechanisms operate in shaping the organization and function of divergent and convergent gene pairs in different plant species.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the evolutionarily conserved Spo11 protein. Studies in yeast have shown that DSB formation requires several other proteins, the role and conservation of which remain unknown. Here we show that two of these               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               proteins, Mei4 and Rec114, are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotes.                                Mei4                 -/-                              mice are deficient in meiotic DSB formation, thus showing the functional conservation of               Mei4               in mice. Cytological analyses reveal that, in mice, MEI4 is localized in discrete foci on the axes of meiotic chromosomes that do not overlap with DMC1 and RPA foci. We thus propose that MEI4 acts as a structural component of the DSB machinery that ensures meiotic DSB formation on chromosome axes. We show that mouse MEI4 and REC114 proteins interact directly, and we identify conserved motifs as required for this interaction. Finally, the unexpected, concomitant absence of Mei4 and Rec114, as well as of Mnd1, Hop2, and Dmc1, in some eukaryotic species (particularly               Neurospora crassa               ,               Drosophila melanogaster               , and               Caenorhabditis elegans               ) suggests the existence of Mei4{\textendash}Rec114-dependent and Mei4{\textendash}Rec114-independent mechanisms for DSB formation, and a functional relationship between the chromosome axis and DSB formation.},

DSB repair promotes homologous interactions and pairing and leads to the formation of crossovers (COs), which are required for the proper reductional segregation at the first meiotic division. In mammals, several hundred DSBs are generated at the beginning of meiotic prophase by the catalytic activity of SPO11. Currently it is not well understood how the frequency and timing of DSB formation and their localization are regulated. Several approaches in humans and mice have provided an extensive description of the localization of initiation events based on CO mapping, leading to the identification and characterization of preferred sites (hotspots) of initiation. This review presents the current knowledge about the proteins known to be involved in this process, the sites where initiation takes place, and the factors that control hotspot localization.},

We also show that MEI1, REC8 and RAD21L are important for proper MEI4 localization. These findings on MEI4 dynamics during meiotic prophase suggest that the association of MEI4 to chromosome axes is required for DSB formation, and that the loss of this association upon DSB repair could contribute to turning off meiotic DSB formation.},

This pathway is essential for proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division and fertility. Meiotic DSBs are catalyzed by Spo11. Several other proteins are essential for meiotic DSB formation, including three evolutionarily conserved proteins first identified in               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               (Mer2, Mei4, and Rec114).

Moreover, MEI4 forms a complex with REC114 and IHO1 in mouse spermatocytes, consistent with cytological observations. We then demonstrated in vitro the formation of a stable complex between REC114 C-terminal domain and MEI4 N-terminal domain. We further determine the structure of the REC114 N-terminal domain that revealed similarity with Pleckstrin homology domains. These analyses provide direct insights into the architecture of these essential components of the meiotic DSB machinery.},

The positions of 240 translocation breakpoints were integrated as physical landmarks into linkage maps of the seven barley chromosomes. This strategy proved to be highly efficient in relating physical to genetic distances. A very heterogeneous distribution of recombination rates was found along individual chromosomes. Recombination is mainly confined to a few relatively small areas spaced by large segments in which recombination is severely suppressed. The regions of highest recombination frequency (’Ö1 Mb/cM) correspond to only 4.9\% of the total barley genome and harbor 47.3\% of the 429 markers of the studied RFLP map. The results for barley correspond well with those obtained by deletion mapping in wheat. This indicates that chromosomal regions characterized by similar recombination frequencies and marker densities are highly conserved between the genomes of barley and wheat. The findings for barley support the conclusions drawn from deletion mapping in wheat that for all plant genomes, notwithstanding their size, the marker-rich regions are all of similar gene density and recombination activity and, therefore, should be equally accessible to map-based cloning.},

Programmed remodelling of the axis occurs during prophase I of meiosis. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has revealed dynamic changes in the chromosome axis in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica oleracea. We show that the axis associated protein ASY1 is depleted during zygotene concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. Study of an Atpch2 mutant demonstrates this requires the conserved AAA+ ATPase, PCH2, which localizes to the sites of axis remodelling. Loss of PCH2 leads to a failure to deplete ASY1 from the axes and compromizes SC polymerisation. Immunolocalization of recombination proteins in Atpch2 indicates that recombination initiation and CO designation during early prophase I occur normally. Evidence suggests that CO interference is initially functional in the mutant but there is a defect in CO maturation following designation. This leads to a reduction in COs and a failure to form COs between some homologous chromosome pairs leading to univalent chromosomes at metaphase I. Genetic analysis reveals that CO distribution is also affected in some chromosome regions. Together these data indicate that the axis remodelling defect in Atpch2 disrupts normal patterned formation of COs.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, interhomolog recombination produces crossovers and noncrossovers to create genetic diversity. Meiotic recombination frequency varies at multiple scales, with high subtelomeric recombination and suppressed centromeric recombination typical in many eukaryotes. During recombination, sister chromatids are tethered as loops to a polymerized chromosome axis, which, in plants, includes the ASY1 HORMA domain protein and REC8{\textendash}cohesin complexes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show an ascending telomere-to-centromere gradient of ASY1 enrichment, which correlates strongly with REC8{\textendash}cohesin ChIP-seq data. We mapped crossovers genome-wide in the absence of ASY1 and observe that telomere-led recombination becomes dominant. Surprisingly,               asy1/+               heterozygotes also remodel crossovers toward subtelomeric regions at the expense of the pericentromeres. Telomeric recombination increases in               asy1/+               occur in distal regions where ASY1 and REC8 ChIP enrichment are lowest in wild type. In wild type, the majority of crossovers show interference, meaning that they are more widely spaced along the chromosomes than expected by chance. To measure interference, we analyzed double crossover distances, MLH1 foci, and fluorescent pollen tetrads. Interestingly, while crossover interference is normal in               asy1/+               , it is undetectable in               asy1               mutants, indicating that ASY1 is required to mediate crossover interference. Together, this is consistent with ASY1 antagonizing telomere-led recombination and promoting spaced crossover formation along the chromosomes via interference. These findings provide insight into the role of the meiotic axis in patterning recombination frequency within plant genomes.},

We describe here several alternative algorithms for constructing human linkage maps given a specified gene order. One method allows maximum-likelihood multilocus linkage maps for dozens of DNA markers in such three-generation pedigrees to be constructed in minutes.},

The distribution of DSBs throughout the genome is not random, but mechanisms molding this landscape remain poorly understood. Here, we exploit genome-wide maps of mouse DSBs at unprecedented nucleotide resolution to uncover previously invisible spatial features of recombination. At fine scale, we reveal a stereotyped hotspot structure{\textemdash}DSBs occur within narrow zones between methylated nucleosomes{\textemdash}and identify relationships between SPO11, chromatin, and the histone methyltransferase PRDM9. At large scale, DSB formation is suppressed on non-homologous portions of the sex chromosomes via the DSB-responsive kinase ATM, which also shapes the autosomal DSB landscape at multiple size scales. We also provide a genome-wide analysis of exonucleolytic DSB resection lengths and elucidate spatial relationships between DSBs and recombination products. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of features governing successive steps in mammalian meiotic recombination.},

Yet, a global quantitative picture, at large evolutionary scale, of the relative strength of gBGC compared with selection and random drift is still lacking. Furthermore, owing to its dependence on the local recombination rate, gBGC results in modulations of the substitution patterns along genomes and across time which, if correctly interpreted, may yield quantitative insights into the long-term evolutionary dynamics of recombination landscapes. Deriving a model of the substitution process at putatively neutral nucleotide positions from population-genetics arguments, and accounting for among-lineage and among-gene effects, we propose a reconstruction of the variation in gBGC intensity at the scale of placental mammals, and of its scaling with body-size and karyotypic traits. Our results are compatible with a simple population genetics model relating gBGC to effective population size and recombination rate. In addition, among-gene variation and phylogenetic patterns of exon-specific levels of gBGC reveal the presence of rugged recombination landscapes, and suggest that short-lived recombination hot-spots are a general feature of placentals. Across placental mammals, variation in gBGC strength spans two orders of magnitude, at its lowest in apes, strongest in lagomorphs, microbats or tenrecs, and near or above the nearly neutral threshold in most other lineages. Combined with among-gene variation, such high levels of biased gene conversion are likely to significantly impact midly selected positions, and to represent a substantial mutation load. Altogether, our analysis suggests a more important role of gBGC in placental genome evolution, compared with what could have been anticipated from studies conducted in anthropoid primates.},

One population (DH) comprised 92 doubled haploids derived from female gametes, while the other population (TC) was a test cross consisting of 44 individuals derived from male gametes. Based on the DH population, a genetic linkage map comprising 160 loci was constructed. Eleven linkage groups that putatively correspond to the 11 gametic chromosomes of C. canephora were identified. The mapped loci included more than 40 specific sequence-tagged site markers, either single-copy RFLP probes or microsatellites, that could serve as standard landmarks in coffee-genome analyses. Furthermore, comparisons for segregation distortion and recombination frequency between the two populations were performed. Although segregation distortions were observed in both populations, the frequency of loci exhibiting a very pronounced degree of distortion was especially high in the DH population. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis of strong zygotic selection among the DH population. The recombination frequencies in both populations were found to be almost indistinguishable. These results offer evidence in favour of the lack of significant sex differences in recombination in C. canephora.},

  abstract = {In humans and many other species, recombination events cluster in narrow and short-lived hot spots distributed across the genome, whose location is determined by the Zn-finger protein PRDM9. To explain these fast evolutionary dynamics, an intra-genomic Red Queen model has been proposed, based on the interplay between two antagonistic forces: biased gene conversion, mediated by double-strand breaks, resulting in hot-spot extinction, followed by positive selection favouring new PRDM9 alleles recognizing new sequence motifs. Thus far, however, this Red Queen model has not been formalized as a quantitative population-genetic model, fully accounting for the intricate interplay between biased gene conversion, mutation, selection, demography and genetic diversity at the PRDM9 locus. Here, we explore the population genetics of the Red Queen model of recombination. A Wright{\textendash}Fisher simulator was implemented, allowing exploration of the behaviour of the model (mean equilibrium recombination rate, diversity at the PRDM9 locus or turnover rate) as a function of the parameters (effective population size, mutation and erosion rates). In a second step, analytical results based on self-consistent mean-field approximations were derived, reproducing the scaling relations observed in the simulations. Empirical fit of the model to current data from the mouse suggests both a high mutation rate at PRDM9 and strong biased gene conversion on its targets.

  abstract = {Cannabis sativa               is widely cultivated for medicinal, food, industrial, and recreational use, but much remains unknown regarding its genetics, including the molecular determinants of cannabinoid content. Here, we describe a combined physical and genetic map derived from a cross between the drug-type strain Purple Kush and the hemp variety ``Finola.'' The map reveals that cannabinoid biosynthesis genes are generally unlinked but that aromatic prenyltransferase (               AP               ), which produces the substrate for THCA and CBDA synthases (THCAS and CBDAS), is tightly linked to a known marker for total cannabinoid content. We further identify the gene encoding CBCA synthase (               CBCAS               ) and characterize its catalytic activity, providing insight into how cannabinoid diversity arises in cannabis.               THCAS               and               CBDAS               (which determine the drug vs. hemp chemotype) are contained within large ({$>$}250 kb) retrotransposon-rich regions that are highly nonhomologous between drug- and hemp-type alleles and are furthermore embedded within {$\sim$}40 Mb of minimally recombining repetitive DNA. The chromosome structures are similar to those in grains such as wheat, with recombination focused in gene-rich, repeat-depleted regions near chromosome ends. The physical and genetic map should facilitate further dissection of genetic and molecular mechanisms in this commercially and medically important plant.},

Several linkage maps had been constructed using dominant and co-dominant markers to facilitate mapping of QTL. However, dominant markers are not easily transferable among different laboratories. We constructed a consensus linkage map for oil palm using co-dominant markers (i.e. microsatellite and SNPs) and two F               1               breeding populations generated by crossing               Dura               and               Pisifera               individuals. Four hundreds and forty-four microsatellites and 36 SNPs were mapped onto 16 linkage groups. The map length was 1565.6\hspace{0.25em}cM, with an average marker space of 3.72\hspace{0.25em}cM. A genome-wide scan of QTL identified a major QTL for stem height on the linkage group 5, which explained 51\% of the phenotypic variation. Genes in the QTL were predicted using the palm genome sequence and bioinformatic tools. The linkage map supplies a base for mapping QTL for accelerating the genetic improvement and will be also useful in the improvement of the assembly of the genome sequences. Markers linked to the QTL may be used in selecting dwarf trees. Genes within the QTL will be characterized to understand the mechanisms underlying dwarfing.},

This paper compares various genomic characters (e.g., range of chromosome numbers and ploidy levels, occurrence of endopolyploidy, GC content, chromosome packaging and organization, genome size) between monocots and the remaining angiosperms to discern just how distinctive monocot genomes are. One of the most notable features of monocots is their wide range and diversity of genome sizes, including the species with the largest genome so far reported in plants. This genomic character is analysed in greater detail, within a phylogenetic context. By surveying available genome size and chromosome data it is apparent that different monocot orders follow distinctive modes of genome size and chromosome evolution. Further insights into genome size-evolution and dynamics were obtained using statistical modelling approaches to reconstruct the ancestral genome size at key nodes across the monocot phylogenetic tree. Such approaches reveal that while the ancestral genome size of all monocots was small (\,pg), there have been several major increases and decreases during monocot evolution. In addition, notable increases in the rates of genome size-evolution were found in Asparagales and Poales compared with other monocot lineages.},

In salmonids, a complex rediploidization process consecutive to an ancient whole genome duplication event makes linkage maps of prime importance for investigating the evolutionary history of chromosome rearrangements. Here, we developed a high-density consensus linkage map for the brown trout (Salmo trutta), a socioeconomically important species heavily impacted by human activities. A total of 3977 ddRAD markers were mapped and ordered in 40 linkage groups using sex- and lineage-averaged recombination distances obtained from two family crosses. Performing map comparison between S. trutta and its sister species, S. salar, revealed extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Strikingly, all of the fusion and fission events that occurred after the S. salar/S. trutta speciation happened in the Atlantic salmon branch, whereas the brown trout remained closer to the ancestral chromosome structure. Using the strongly conserved synteny within chromosome arms, we aligned the brown trout linkage map to the Atlantic salmon genome sequence to estimate the local recombination rate in S. trutta at 3721 loci. A significant positive correlation between recombination rate and within-population nucleotide diversity ({$\pi$}) was found, indicating that selection constrains variation at linked neutral sites in brown trout. This new high-density linkage map provides a useful genomic resource for future aquaculture, conservation, and eco-evolutionary studies in brown trout.},

  abstract = {Most models describing the evolution of recombination have focused on the case of a single population, implicitly assuming that all individuals are equally likely to mate and that spatial heterogeneity in selection is absent. In these models, the evolution of recombination is driven by linkage disequilibria generated either by epistatic selection or drift. Models based on epistatic selection show that recombination can be favored if epistasis is negative and weak compared to directional selection and if the recombination modifier locus is tightly linked to the selected loci. In this article, we examine the joint effects of spatial heterogeneity in selection and epistasis on the evolution of recombination. In a model with two patches, each subject to different selection regimes, we consider the cases of mutation-selection and migrationselection balance as well as the spread of beneficial alleles. We find that including spatial heterogeneity extends the range of epistasis over which recombination can be favored. Indeed, recombination can be favored without epistasis, with negative and even with positive epistasis depending on environmental circumstances. The selection pressure acting on recombination-modifier loci is often much stronger with spatial heterogeneity, and even loosely linked modifiers and free linkage may evolve. In each case, predicting whether recombination is favored requires knowledge of both the type of environmental heterogeneity and epistasis, as none of these factors alone is sufficient to predict the outcome.},

  abstract = {GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a process associated with recombination that favors the transmission of GC alleles over AT alleles during meiosis. gBGC plays a major role in genome evolution in many eukaryotes. However, the molecular mechanisms of gBGC are still unknown. Different steps of the recombination process could potentially cause gBGC: the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), the invasion of the homologous or sister chromatid, and the repair of mismatches in heteroduplexes. To investigate these models, we analyzed a genome-wide data set of crossovers (COs) and noncrossovers (NCOs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the overtransmission of GC alleles is specific to COs and that it occurs among conversion tracts in which all alleles are converted from the same donor haplotype. Thus, gBGC results from a process that leads to long-patch repair. We show that gBGC is associated with longer tracts and that it is driven by the nature (GC or AT) of the alleles located at the extremities of the tract. These observations invalidate the hypotheses that gBGC is due to the base excision repair machinery or to a bias in DSB formation and suggest that in S. cerevisiae, gBGC is caused by the mismatch repair (MMR) system. We propose that the presence of nicks on both DNA strands during CO resolution could be the cause of the bias in MMR activity. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that gBGC is a nonadaptive consequence of a selective pressure to limit the mutation rate in mitotic cells.},

  abstract = {Recombination is an essential process in eukaryotes, which increases diversity by disrupting genetic linkage between loci and ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. In the human genome, recombination events are clustered in hotspots, whose location is determined by the PRDM9 protein. There is evidence that the location of hotspots evolves rapidly, as a consequence of changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domain. However, the reasons for these changes and the rate at which they occur are not known. In this study, we investigated the evolution of human hotspot loci and of PRDM9 target motifs, both in modern and archaic human lineages (Denisovan) to quantify the dynamic of hotspot turnover during the recent period of human evolution. We show that present-day human hotspots are young: they have been active only during the last 10\% of the time since the divergence from chimpanzee, starting to be operating shortly before the split between Denisovans and modern humans. Surprisingly, however, our analyses indicate that Denisovan recombination hotspots did not overlap with modern human ones, despite sharing similar PRDM9 target motifs. We further show that high-affinity PRDM9 target motifs are subject to a strong self-destructive drive, known as biased gene conversion (BGC), which should lead to the loss of the majority of them in the next 3 MYR. This depletion of PRDM9 genomic targets is expected to decrease fitness, and thereby to favor new PRDM9 alleles binding different motifs. Our refined estimates of the age and life expectancy of human hotspots provide empirical evidence in support of the Red Queen hypothesis of recombination hotspots evolution.},

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} The muscadine grape, Vitis rotundifolia, is a specialty crop native to the southeastern USA. Muscadine vines can be male, female, or perfect-flowered, and berry color ranges from bronze to black. Genetic linkage maps were constructed using genotyping-by-sequencing in two \-F1 populations segregating for flower sex and berry color. The linkage maps consisted of 1244 and 2069 markers assigned to 20 linkage groups (LG) for the `Black Beauty' {\texttimes} `Nesbitt' and `Supreme' {\texttimes} `Nesbitt' populations, respectively. Data from both populations were used to generate a consensus map with 2346 markers across 20 LGs. A high degree of collinearity was observed between the genetic maps and the Vitis vinifera physical map. The higher chromosome number in muscadine (2n\,=\,40) compared to V. vinifera (2n\,=\,38) was accounted for by the behavior of V. vinifera chromosome 7 as two independently segregating LGs in muscadine. The muscadine sex locus mapped to an interval that aligned to 4.64{\textendash}5.09 Mb on V. vinifera chromosome 2, a region which includes the previously described V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris sex locus. While the MYB transcription factor genes controlling fruit color in V. vinifera are located on chromosome 2, the muscadine berry color locus mapped to an interval aligning to 11.09{\textendash}11.88 Mb on V. vinifera chromosome 4, suggesting that a mutation in a different gene in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway determines berry color in muscadine. These linkage maps lay the groundwork for marker-assisted breeding in muscadine and provide insight into the evolution of Vitis species.},

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a cytological recombination map has been constructed based on LN positions. We demonstrate that the mismatch repair protein MLH1 occurs in LNs. We determined the positions of MLH1 foci along the 12 tomato chromosome pairs (bivalents) during meiotic prophase and compared the map of MLH1 focus positions with that of LN positions. On all 12 bivalents, the number of MLH1 foci was {$\sim$}70\% of the number of LNs. Bivalents with zero MLH1 foci were rare, which argues against random failure of detecting MLH1 in the LNs. We inferred that there are two types of LNs, MLH1-positive and MLH1-negative LNs, and that each bivalent gets an obligate MLH1-positive LN. The two LN types are differently distributed along the bivalents. Furthermore, cytological interference among MLH1 foci was much stronger than interference among LNs, implying that MLH1 marks the positions of a subset of strongly interfering crossovers. Based on the distances between MLH1 foci or LNs, we propose that MLH1-positive and MLH1-negative LNs stem from the same population of weakly interfering precursors.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) to implement accurate and robust spike sorting. The results of the simulated data demonstrated that the clustering accuracy in most datasets was greater than 99\%, despite the multiple levels of noise and various degrees of overlapped spikes. Moreover, the proposed method performed significantly better than the state-of-the-art method named ``WMsorting'' and a deep-learning-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. In addition, the experimental data recorded from the primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey were used to evaluate the proposed method in a practical application. It was shown that the method could successfully isolate most spikes of different neurons (ranging from two to five) by training the 1D-CNN model with a small number of manually labeled spikes. Considering the above, the deep learning method proposed in this paper is of great advantage for spike sorting with high accuracy and strong robustness. It lays the foundation for application in more challenging works, such as distinguishing overlapped spikes and the simultaneous sorting of multichannel recordings.},

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an exception to these general rules, was reported to have the highest CO number per chromosome and no or weak interference. However, global CO frequency was indirectly estimated, calling for confirmation. Here, we used an innovative strategy to determine COs genome-wide in S. pombe. We confirmed weak CO interference, acting at physical distances compatible with the patterning of recombination precursors. We revealed a slight co-variation in CO number between chromosomes, suggesting that a limiting pro-CO factor varies between meiocytes. CO number per chromosome varies proportionally with chromosome size, with the three chromosomes having, on average, 15.9, 12.5, and 7.0 COs, respectively. This reinforces S. pombe's status as the eukaryote with the highest CO number per chromosome described to date.},

Multiple factors can influence the choice and the restrictiveness of repair towards a given pathway in order to warrant the maintenance of genome integrity. During V(D)J recombination, RAG-induced DSBs are (almost) exclusively repaired by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the benefit of antigen receptor gene diversity. Here, we review the various parameters that constrain repair of RAG-generated DSBs to NHEJ, including the peculiarity of DNA DSB ends generated by the RAG nuclease, the establishment and maintenance of a post-cleavage synaptic complex, and the protection of DNA ends against resection and (micro)homology-directed repair. In this physiological context, we highlight that certain DSBs have limited DNA repair pathway choice options.},

It was the basal eudicot species occupying a critical phylogenetic position in flowering plants. After the domestication for thousands of years, lotus has differentiated into three cultivated types -flower lotus, seed lotus and rhizome lotus. Although the phenotypic and genetic differentiations based on molecular markers have been reported, the variation on whole-genome level among the different lotus types is still ambiguous.                                                        Results               In order to reveal the evolution and domestication characteristics of lotus, a total of 69 lotus accessions were selected, including 45 cultivated accessions, 22 wild sacred lotus accessions, and 2 wild American lotus accessions. With Illumina technology, the genomes of these lotus accessions were resequenced to {$>$}\,13{\texttimes} raw data coverage. On the basis of these genomic data, 25 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in lotus. Population analysis showed that the rhizome and seed lotus were monophyletic and genetically homogeneous, whereas the flower lotus was biphyletic and genetically heterogeneous. Using population SNP data, we identified 1214 selected regions in seed lotus, 95 in rhizome lotus, and 37 in flower lotus. Some of the genes in these regions contributed to the essential domestication traits of lotus. The selected genes of seed lotus mainly affected lotus seed weight, size and nutritional quality. While the selected genes were responsible for insect resistance, antibacterial immunity and freezing and heat stress resistance in flower lotus, and improved the size of rhizome in rhizome lotus, respectively.                                         Conclusions               The genome differentiation and a set of domestication genes were identified from three types of cultivated lotus- flower lotus, seed lotus and rhizome lotus, respectively. Among cultivated lotus, flower lotus showed the greatest variation. The domestication genes may show agronomic importance via enhancing insect resistance, improving seed weight and size, or regulating lotus rhizome size. The domestication history of lotus enhances our knowledge of perennial aquatic crop evolution, and the obtained dataset provides a basis for future genomics-enabled breeding.},

Tree Peony (Paeonia suffruticosa Andr. Moutan DC.) is a traditional flowering plant in China, with important ornamental value, which have been spread around the world. However, less genetic and genomic information is available for the tree peony molecular studies. Here, we performed restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) of an F1 population, derived from a traditional variety ``Qing Long Wo Mo Chi (QL)'' and a variety ``Mo Zi Lian (MZL)''. High-density genetic maps were developed using RADseq markers for female (1471 markers) and male (793 markers) parents. They covered 965.69 and 870.21 cM, with the average marker intervals of 0.66 and 1.10 cM along the seven and five linkage groups (LGs), respectively. Furthermore, the identified markers were assigned to 1671 bins, representing the unique genetic positions in LGs, and inter-marker distances smaller than 5 cM covered 97.93\% of genetic maps. This study suggests that rapid de novo construction of genetic maps in peony could be conducted through RADseq approach, which provides an important tool for further linkage mapping and genomic structure analysis, and enable development of molecular markers for molecular breeding in tree peony.},

  abstract = {Background: High-resolution genetic linkage map is critical for QTL mapping, genome sequence assembly and marker-assisted selection in aquaculture species. The ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda is one of the most economic shrimp species naturally distributed in the coasts of eastern China and western Korea. However, quite limited genomics and genetics information have been exploited for genetic improvement of economic traits in this species. Results: In the present study, we conducted genome survey and constructed high-resolution genetic linkage maps of the ridgetail white prawn with reciprocal-cross mapping family genotyped using next-generation sequencing approaches. The estimated genome size was 9.33 Gb with a heterozygosity of 0.26\% and a repeat sequence ratio of 76.62\%. 65,772 protein-coding genes were identified by genome annotation. A total of 10,384 SNPs were used to high-throughput genotyping and assigned to 45 linkage groups (LGs) from reciprocal backcross families of E. carinicauda, and the average marker distances were 0.73 cM and 0.55 cM, respectively. Based on the high-resolution linkage map, twenty-three QTLs related to five growth traits were detected. All QTLs could explain 8.8{\textendash}15.7\% of the total growth-traits variation. Conclusions: The genome size of E. carinicauda was estimated more accurately by genome survey analysis, which revealed basic genomic architecture.

By~intercrossing two diverged mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequencing 119 offspring, we~detect thousands of crossover and non-crossover events genome-wide~with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. We find that both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at DSB hotspots where the DSB-positioning protein PRDM9 fails to bind to the unbroken homologous chromosome, revealing that PRDM9 also functions to promote homologue-templated repair. Our results show that complex non-crossovers are much rarer in mice than humans, consistent with complex events arising from accumulated non-programmed DNA damage. Unexpectedly, we also find that GC-biased gene conversion is restricted to non-crossover tracts containing only one mismatch. These results demonstrate that local genetic diversity profoundly alters meiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and               Prdm9               -related hybrid infertility.},

In this study, we first constructed an integrated simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based consensus genetic map for pear based on common SSR markers between nine published maps. A total of 5,085 markers, including 1,232 SSRs and 3,853 SNPs, were localized on a consensus map spanning 3,266.0 cM in total, with an average marker interval of 0.64 cM, which represents the highest density consensus map of pear to date. Using three sets of highdensity SNP-based genetic maps with European pear genetic backgrounds, we anchored a total of 291.5 Mb of the `Bartlett' v1.0 (Pyrus communis L.) genome scaffolds into 17 pseudochromosomes. This accounted for 50.5\% of the genome assembly, which was a great improvement on the 29.7\% achieved originally. Intra-genome and inter-genome synteny analyses of the new `Bartlett' v1.1 genome assembly with the Asian pear `Dangshansuli' (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.) and apple (Malus {\^A} domestica Borkh.) genomes uncovered four new segmental duplication regions. The integrated high-density SSR and SNP-based consensus genetic map provided new insights into the genetic structure patterns of pear and assisted in the genome assembly of `Bartlett' through further exploration of different pear genetic maps.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is fundamental for generating new genetic variation and for securing proper disjunction. Further, recombination plays an essential role during the rediploidization process of polyploid-origin genomes because crossovers between pairs of homeologous chromosomes retain duplicated regions. A better understanding of how recombination affects genome evolution is crucial for interpreting genomic data; unfortunately, current knowledge mainly originates from a few model species. Salmonid fishes provide a valuable system for studying the effects of recombination in nonmodel species. Salmonid females generally produce thousands of embryos, providing large families for conducting inheritance studies. Further, salmonid genomes are currently rediploidizing after a whole genome duplication and can serve as models for studying the role of homeologous crossovers on genome evolution. Here, we present a detailed interrogation of recombination patterns in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). First, we use RAD sequencing of haploid and diploid gynogenetic families to construct a dense linkage map that includes paralogous loci and location of centromeres. We find a nonrandom distribution of paralogs that mainly cluster in extended regions distally located on 11 different chromosomes, consistent with ongoing homeologous recombination in these regions. We also estimate the strength of interference across each chromosome; results reveal strong interference and crossovers are mostly limited to one per arm. Interference was further shown to continue across centromeres, but metacentric chromosomes generally had at least one crossover on each arm. We discuss the relevance of these findings for both mapping and population genomic studies.},

Still, many emerging maps do not locate centromeres {\textendash} an essential component of the genomic landscape. Here, we demonstrate that for genomes with strong chiasma interference, approximate centromere placement is possible by phasing the same data used to generate linkage maps. Assuming one obligate crossover per chromosome arm, information about centromere location can be revealed by tracking the accumulated recombination frequency along linkage groups, similar to half-tetrad analyses. We validate the method on a linkage map for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) with known centromeric regions. Further tests suggest that the method will work well in other salmonids and other eukaryotes. However, the method performed weakly when applied to a male linkage map (rainbow trout; O. mykiss) characterized by low and unevenly distributed recombination {\textendash} a general feature of male meiosis in many species. Further, a high frequency of double crossovers along chromosome arms in barley reduced resolution for locating centromeric regions on most linkage groups. Despite these limitations, our method should work well for high-density maps in species with strong recombination interference and will enrich many existing and future mapping resources.},

We anchored 216 of the original 308 AFLP markers to their respective restriction sites using an in silicoapproach. The map resolution was improved by adding 146 sequence-tagged microsatellite markers and 39 sequenced gene markers. The new markers confirmed the positions of the anchored AFLP markers, fused the original 39 linkage groups together into 17, and fully expanded 12 of these to single groups covering entire chromosomes. Map coverage of the genome increased from 55.3\% to 92.8\%, with 96.3\% of 430 markers collinearly aligned with the genome sequence. The anchored map also improved the H. irregulare assembly considerably. It identified several errors in scaffold arrangements and assisted in reducing the total number of major scaffolds from 18 to 15. This denser, more comprehensive map allowed sequence-based mapping of three intersterility loci and one mating type locus. This demonstrates the possibility to utilize an in silico procedure to convert anonymous markers into sequence-tagged ones, as well as the power of a sequenceanchored linkage map and its usefulness in the assembly of a whole genome sequence.},

The sizes of the groups (from 5.9 to 9.9\% of the total map length) correlated well with previous estimates of chromosome sizes (from 5.8 to 10.8\% of total genome size). Any locus in the genome has a 97\% probability to be within 10 cM from a mapped marker, which makes the map suited for QTL mapping. Infecting the progeny trees with the root rot pathogen Heterobasidion parviporum allowed for mapping of four different resistance traits: lesion length at the inoculation site, fungal spread within the sapwood, exclusion of the pathogen from the host after initial infection, and ability to prevent the infection from establishing at all. These four traits were associated with two, four, four and three QTL regions respectively of which none overlapped between the traits. Each QTL explained between 4.6 and 10.1\% of the respective traits phenotypic variation. Although the QTL regions contain many more genes than the ones represented by the SNP markers, at least four markers within the confidence intervals originated from genes with known function in conifer defence; a leucoanthocyanidine reductase, which has previously been shown to upregulate during H. parviporum infection, and three intermediates of the lignification process; a hydroxycinnamoyl CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, a 4coumarate CoA ligase, and a R2R3-MYB transcription factor.},

Here, we constructed an integrative database: the Nelumbo Genome Database (NGD,               http://nelumbo.biocloud.net               ). This database is a collection of the most updated lotus genome assembly and contains information on both gene expression in different tissues and coexpression networks. In the NGD, we also integrated genetic variants and key traits from our 62 newly sequenced lotus cultivars and 26 previously reported cultivars, which are valuable for lotus germplasm studies. As applications including BLAST, BLAT, Primer, Annotation Search, Variant and Trait Search are deployed, users can perform sequence analyses and gene searches via the NGD. Overall, the valuable genomic resources provided in the NGD will facilitate future studies on population genetics and molecular breeding of lotus.},

  abstract = {Recombination is a fundamental evolutionary force. Therefore the population recombination rate r plays an important role in the analysis of population genetic data; however, it is notoriously difficult to estimate. This difficulty applies both to the accuracy of commonly used estimates and to the computational efforts required to obtain them. Some particularly popular methods are based on approximations to the likelihood. They require considerably less computational efforts than the full-likelihood method with not much less accuracy. Nevertheless, the computation of these approximate estimates can still be very time consuming, in particular when the sample size is large. Although auxiliary quantities for composite likelihood estimates can be computed in advance and stored in tables, these tables need to be recomputed if either the sample size or the mutation rate u changes. Here we introduce a new method based on regression combined with boosting as a model selection technique. For large samples, it requires much less computational effort than other approximate methods, while providing similar levels of accuracy. Notably, for a sample of hundreds or thousands of individuals, the estimate of r using regression can be obtained on a single personal computer within a couple of minutes while other methods may need a couple of days or months (or even years). When the sample size is smaller (n \# 50), our new method remains computational efficient but produces biased estimates. We expect the new estimates to be helpful when analyzing large samples and/ or many loci with possibly different mutation rates.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an essential biological process that ensures faithful chromosome segregation and promotes parental allele shuffling. Tetrad analysis is a powerful approach to quantify the genetic makeups and recombination landscapes of meiotic products. Here we present RecombineX (               https://github.com/yjx1217/RecombineX               ), a generalized computational framework that automates the full workflow of marker identification, gamete genotyping, and tetrad-based recombination profiling based on any organism or genetic background with batch processing capability. Aside from conventional reference-based analysis, RecombineX can also perform analysis based on parental genome assemblies, which facilitates analyzing meiotic recombination landscapes in their native genomic contexts. Additional features such as copy number variation profiling and missing genotype inference further enhance downstream analysis. RecombineX also includes a dedicate module for simulating the genomes and reads of recombinant tetrads, which enables fine-tuned simulation-based hypothesis testing. This simulation module revealed the power and accuracy of RecombineX even when analyzing tetrads with very low sequencing depths (e.g., 1-2X). Tetrad sequencing data from the budding yeast               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               and green alga               Chlamydomonas reinhardtii               were further used to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of RecombineX for organisms with both small and large genomes, manifesting RecombineX as an all-around one stop solution for future tetrad analysis. Interestingly, our re-analysis of the budding yeast tetrad sequencing data with RecombineX and Oxford Nanopore sequencing revealed two unusual structural rearrangement events that were not noticed before, which exemplify the occasional genome instability triggered by meiosis.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Meiotic crossovers (COs) are required for accurate chromosome segregation and mix parental genomes to generate genetically diversified gametes. The distribution of COs among chromosomes is not random. In most organisms, at least one CO is formed between each chromosome pair. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling CO distribution are not well understood. Here, we found that               Arabidopsis               AtFANCD2, AtFANCM, AtFIGL1, and AtRMI1 promote normal distribution of Class I CO to maintain CO assurance in addition to their previously described roles in regulating Class II CO number. These factors, alone or in combination, appear to control {$\sim$}50\% of the variation between wild-type and random distributions. These discoveries provide genetic insights into understanding of the regulation of CO distribution among chromosomes.                        ,                             During meiosis, crossovers (COs) are typically required to ensure faithful chromosomal segregation. Despite the requirement for at least one CO between each pair of chromosomes, closely spaced double COs are usually underrepresented due to a phenomenon called CO interference. Like               Mus musculus               and               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               ,               Arabidopsis thaliana               has both interference-sensitive (Class I) and interference-insensitive (Class II) COs. However, the underlying mechanism controlling CO distribution remains largely elusive. Both AtMUS81 and AtFANCD2 promote the formation of Class II CO. Using both AtHEI10 and AtMLH1 immunostaining, two markers of Class I COs, we show that AtFANCD2 but not AtMUS81 is required for normal Class I CO distribution among chromosomes. Depleting               AtFANCD2               leads to a CO distribution pattern that is intermediate between that of wild-type and a Poisson distribution. Moreover, in               Atfancm               ,               Atfigl1               , and               Atrmi1               mutants where increased Class II CO frequency has been reported previously, we observe Class I CO distribution patterns that are strikingly similar to               Atfancd2.               Surprisingly, we found that AtFANCD2 plays opposite roles in regulating CO frequency in               Atfancm               compared with either in               Atfigl1               or               Atrmi1.               Together, these results reveal that although AtFANCD2, AtFANCM, AtFIGL1, and AtRMI1 regulate Class II CO frequency by distinct mechanisms, they have similar roles in controlling the distribution of Class I COs among chromosomes.},

Alfalfa, one of the most important forage crops in the world, is autotetraploid, allogamous, and highly heterozygous, characteristics that have impeded the construction of a high-density linkage map using traditional genetic marker systems. Using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we constructed low-cost, reasonably high-density linkage maps for both maternal and paternal parental genomes of an autotetraploid alfalfa F1 population. The resulting maps contain 3591 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers on 64 linkage groups across both parents, with an average density of one marker per 1.5 and 1.0 cM for the maternal and paternal haplotype maps, respectively. Chromosome assignments were made based on homology of markers to the M. truncatula genome. Four linkage groups representing the four haplotypes of each alfalfa chromosome were assigned to each of the eight Medicago chromosomes in both the maternal and paternal parents. The alfalfa linkage groups were highly syntenous with M. truncatula, and clearly identified the known translocation between Chromosomes 4 and 8. In addition, a small inversion on Chromosome 1 was identified between M. truncatula and M. sativa. GBS enabled us to develop a saturated linkage map for alfalfa that greatly improved genome coverage relative to previous maps and that will facilitate investigation of genome structure. GBS could be used in breeding populations to accelerate molecular breeding in alfalfa.},

  abstract = {Background: Cucumber, Cucumis sativus L. (2n = 2 {\texttimes} = 14) and melon, C. melo L. (2n = 2 {\texttimes} = 24) are two important vegetable species in the genus Cucumis (family Cucurbitaceae). Both species have an Asian origin that diverged approximately nine million years ago. Cucumber is believed to have evolved from melon through chromosome fusion, but the details of this process are largely unknown. In this study, comparative genetic mapping between cucumber and melon was conducted to examine syntenic relationships of their chromosomes. Results: Using two melon mapping populations, 154 and 127 cucumber SSR markers were added onto previously reported F2- and RIL-based genetic maps, respectively. A consensus melon linkage map was developed through map integration, which contained 401 co-dominant markers in 12 linkage groups including 199 markers derived from the cucumber genome. Syntenic relationships between melon and cucumber chromosomes were inferred based on associations between markers on the consensus melon map and cucumber draft genome scaffolds. It was determined that cucumber Chromosome 7 was syntenic to melon Chromosome I. Cucumber Chromosomes 2 and 6 each contained genomic regions that were syntenic with melon chromosomes III+V+XI and III+VIII+XI, respectively. Likewise, cucumber Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and 5 each was syntenic with genomic regions of two melon chromosomes previously designated as II+XII, IV+VI, VII+VIII, and IX+X, respectively. However, the marker orders in several syntenic blocks on these consensus linkage maps were not co-linear suggesting that more complicated structural changes beyond simple chromosome fusion events have occurred during the evolution of cucumber. Conclusions: Comparative mapping conducted herein supported the hypothesis that cucumber chromosomes may be the result of chromosome fusion from a 24-chromosome progenitor species. Except for a possible inversion, cucumber Chromosome 7 has largely remained intact in the past nine million years since its divergence from melon. Meanwhile, many structural changes may have occurred during the evolution of the remaining six cucumber chromosomes. Further characterization of the genomic nature of Cucumis species closely related to cucumber and melon might provide a better understanding of the evolutionary history leading to modern cucumber.},

A total of 48 InDel markers that yielded polymorphic and unambiguous fragments were developed when screening six tea cultivars. These markers were further deployed on 46 tea cultivars for transferability and genetic diversity analysis, exhibiting information with an average 4.02 of the number of alleles (                 Na                 ) and 0.457 of polymorphism information content (PIC). The dendrogram showed that the phylogenetic relationships among these tea cultivars are highly consistent with their genetic backgrounds or original places. Interestingly, we observed that the catechin/caffeine contents between `Shuchazao' and `Yunkang 10' were significantly different, and a large number of SNPs/InDels were identified within catechin/caffeine biosynthesis-related genes.                                                        Conclusion               The identified genome-wide genetic variations and newly-developed InDel markers will provide a valuable resource for tea plant genetic and genomic studies, especially the SNPs/InDels within catechin/caffeine biosynthesis-related genes, which may serve as pivotal candidates for elucidating the molecular mechanism governing catechin/caffeine biosynthesis.},

By resequencing numerous accessions of these and closely related species, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion/deletions (InDels) have been identified to assist in clarifying local adaptation and phenotypic diversification. A chromosome-level genome assembly for P. adenopoda was assembled based on Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms, facilitated by Hi-C technology. The assembled genome size was about 383 Mb, with 99.70\% of the contigs anchored to 19 pseudo-chromosomes, and a total of 33,505 protein-coding genes were annotated. This high-quality genome provided the genomic basis for the subsequent detection of various variants.},

  abstract = {Linkage maps enable the study of important biological questions. The construction of high-density linkage maps appears more feasible since the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which eases SNP discovery and high-throughput genotyping of large population. However, the marker number explosion and genotyping errors from NGS data challenge the computational efficiency and linkage map quality of linkage study methods. Here we report the HighMap method for constructing high-density linkage maps from NGS data. HighMap employs an iterative ordering and error correction strategy based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm and a Monte Carlo multipoint maximum likelihood algorithm. Simulation study shows HighMap can create a linkage map with three times as many markers as ordering-only methods while offering more accurate marker orders and stable genetic distances. Using HighMap, we constructed a common carp linkage map with 10,004 markers. The singleton rate was less than one-ninth of that generated by JoinMap4.1. Its total map distance was 5,908 cM, consistent with reports on low-density maps. HighMap is an efficient method for constructing high-density, highquality linkage maps from high-throughput population NGS data. It will facilitate genome assembling, comparative genomic analysis, and QTL studies. HighMap is available at http://highmap.biomarker.com.cn/.},

Knowledge of its genetic foundation is limited because sufficient molecular markers have not been developed and therefore a high-density genetic linkage map is incomplete. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a recently developed high-throughput strategy for large-scale SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) discovery and genotyping based on next generation sequencing (NGS). In this study, genomic DNA extracted from two parents and their 96 F1 individuals was subjected to high-throughput sequencing and SLAF library construction. A total of 155.96\,Mb of data containing 155,958,181 pair-end reads were obtained after preprocessing. The average coverage of each SLAF marker was 83.43-fold for the parents compared with 10.36-fold for the F               1               offspring. The final linkage map consists of 5,164 SLAFs in 8 linkage groups (LGs) and spans 1,516.43\,cM, with an average distance of 0.29\,cM between adjacent markers. The results will not only provide a platform for mapping quantitative trait loci but also offer a critical new tool for               S. miltiorrhiza               biotechnology and comparative genomics as well as a valuable reference for TCM studies.},

  abstract = {Background: The sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is widely cultivated in China for its edible rhizomes and seeds. Traditional plant breeding methods have been used to breed cultivars with increased yields and quality of rhizomes and seeds with limited success. Currently, the available genetic maps and molecular markers in lotus are too limited to be useful for molecular genetics based breeding programs. However, the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled large-scale identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic map construction. In this study, we constructed an SNP-based high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus using double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). Results: An F2 population of 96 individuals was derived from a cross between the rhizome lotus cultivar `Juwuba' (male parent) and the seed lotus cultivar `Mantianxing' (female parent). Genomic DNAs from this population were digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and MspI and then sequenced. In total, 133.65 Gb of raw data containing 1,088,935,610 pair-end reads were obtained. The coverage of reads on a reference genome was 7.2 \% for the female parent, 6.56 \% for the male parent, and 1.46 \% for F2 individuals. From these reads, 10,753 valid SNP markers were used for genetic map construction. Finally, 791 bin markers (so-segregated adjacent SNPs treated as a bin marker), consisting of 8,971 SNP markers, were sorted into 8 linkage groups (LGs) that spanned 581.3 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.74 cM. A total of 809 genome sequence scaffolds, covering about 565.9 cM of the wild sacred lotus genome, were anchored on the genetic map, accounting for 70.6 \% of the genome assembly. Conclusions: This study reports the large-scale discovery of SNPs between cultivars of rhizome and seed lotus using a ddRADseq library combined with NGS. These SNPs have been used to construct the first high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus that can serve as a genomic reference and will facilitate genetic mapping of important traits in the parental cultivars.},

  abstract = {Hybridization and resulting introgression are important processes shaping the tree of life and appear to be far more common than previously thought. However, how the genome evolution was shaped by various genetic and evolutionary forces after hybridization remains unresolved. Here we used whole genome resequencing data of 227 individuals from multiple widespread Populus species to characterize their contemporary patterns of hybridization and to quantify genomic signatures of past introgression. We observe a high frequency of contemporary hybridization and confirm that multiple previously ambiguous species are in fact F1 hybrids. Seven species were identified, which experienced different demographic histories that resulted in strikingly varied efficacy of selection and burdens of deleterious mutations. Frequent past introgression has been found to be a pervasive feature throughout the speciation of these Populus species. The retained introgressed regions, more generally, tend to contain reduced genetic load and to be located in regions of high recombination. We also find that in pairs of species with substantial differences in effective population size, introgressed regions are inferred to have undergone selective sweeps at greater than expected frequencies in the species with lower effective population size, suggesting that introgression likely have higher potential to provide beneficial variation for species with small populations. Our results, therefore, illustrate that demography and recombination have interplayed with both positive and negative selection in determining the genomic evolution after hybridization.},

Recombination, crossover in particular, shuffles mutations and impacts both the level of genetic polymorphism and the speed of adaptation. In many species, the recombination rate varies across the genome with hot- and cold-spots. The hotspot paradox hypothesis asserts that recombination hotspots are evolutionarily unstable due to self-destruction. However, the genomic landscape of doublestrand breaks (DSBs), which initiate recombination, is evolutionarily conserved among divergent yeast species, casting doubt on the hotspot paradox hypothesis. Nonetheless, because only a subset of DSBs are associated with crossovers, the evolutionary conservation of the crossover landscape could differ from that of DSBs. Here we investigate this possibility by generating a high-resolution recombination map of the budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus through whole-genome sequencing of fifty meiotic tetrads and by comparing this recombination map with that of S. cerevisiae. We observe a 40\% lower recombination rate in S. paradoxus than in S. cerevisiae. Compared with the DSB landscape, the crossover landscape is even more conserved. Further analyses indicate that the elevated conservation of the crossover landscape is explained by a near-subtelomeric crossover preference in both yeasts, which we find to be attributable at least in part to crossover interference. We conclude that the yeast crossover landscape is highly conserved and that the evolutionary conservation of this landscape can differ from that of the DSB landscape.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate a method for developing populations suitable for genome-wide high-resolution genetic linkage mapping, by recurrent intermating among F2 individuals derived from crosses between homozygous parents. Comparison of intermated progenies to F2 and ``recombinant inbred'' (RI) populations from the same pedigree corroborate theoretical expectations that progenies intermated for four generations harbor about threefold more information for estimating recombination fraction between closely linked markers than either RI-selfed or F2 individuals (which are, in fact, equivalent in this regard). Although intermated populations are heterozygous, homozygous ``intermated recombinant inbred'' (IRI) populations can readily be generated, combining additional information afforded by intermating with the permanence of RI populations. Intermated populations permit fine-mapping of genetic markers throughout a genome, helping to bridge the gap between genetic map resolution and the DNA-carrying capacity of modern cloning vectors, thus facilitating merger of genetic and physical maps. Intermating can also facilitate high-resolution mapping of genes and QTLs, accelerating map-based cloning. Finally, intermated populations will facilitate investigation of other fundamental genetic questions requiring a genome-wide high-resolution analysis, such as comparative mapping of distantly related species, and the genetic basis of heterosis.},

The efficiency of breeding improved Miscanthus biomass cultivars could be greatly increased by marker-assisted selection. Thus, a high-density genetic map is critical to Miscanthus improvement. In this study, a mapping population of 261 F1 progeny was developed from a cross between two diploid M. sinensis cultivars, `Strictus' and `Kaskade'. High-density genetic maps for the two parents were produced with 3044 newly developed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing, and 138 previously mapped GoldenGate SNPs.

The length of the male parent (`Kaskade') map was 1612 cM, with 1821 SNPs, and an average intermarker spacing of 0.9 cM. The utility of the map was confirmed by locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the zebra-striped trait, which was segregating in this population. Three QTL for zebra-striped presence/absence (zb1, zb2 on LG 7, and zb3 on LG 10) and three for zebra-striped intensity (zbi1, zbi2, zbi3 on LGs 7, 10, 3) were identified. Each allele that caused striping was recessive. Incomplete penetrance was observed for each zb QTL, but penetrance was greatest when two or more zb QTL were homozygous for the causative alleles. Similarly, the intensity of striping was greatest when two or more zbi QTL were homozygous for alleles that conferred the trait. Comparative mapping indicated putative correspondence between zb3 and/or zbi2 on LG 10 to previously sequenced genes conferring zebra stripe in maize and rice. These results demonstrate that the new map is useful for identifying marker{\textendash}trait associations. The mapped markers will become a valuable community resource, facilitating comparisons among studies and the breeding of Miscanthus.},

  abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has been identified as a promising cellulosic biofuel crop in the United States. Construction of a genetic linkage map is fundamental for switchgrass molecular breeding and the elucidation of its genetic mechanisms for economically important traits. In this study, a novel population consisting of 139 selfed progeny of a northern lowland genotype, NL 94 LYE 16X13, was used to construct a linkage map. A total of 2493 simple sequence repeat markers were screened for polymorphism. Of 506 polymorphic loci, 80.8\% showed a goodness-of-fit of 1:2:1 segregation ratio. Among 469 linked loci on the framework map, 241 coupling vs. 228 repulsion phase linkages were detected that conformed to a 1:1 ratio, confirming disomic inheritance. A total of 499 loci were mapped to 18 linkage groups (LG), of which the cumulative length was 2085.2 cM, with an average marker interval of 4.2 cM. Nine homeologous LG pairs were identified based on multi-allele markers and comparative genomic analysis. Two clusters of segregationdistorted loci were identified on LG 5b and 9b, respectively. Comparative analysis indicated a one-to-one relationship between nine switchgrass homeologous groups and nine foxtail millet (Setaria italica) chromosomes, suggesting strong homology between the two species. The linkage map derived from selfing a heterozygous parent, instead of two separate maps usually constructed for a cross-fertilized species, provides a new genetic framework to facilitate genomics research, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, and markerassisted breeding.},

The linkage map contains 9164 SNP markers covering 1832.9 cM. 1232 bins account for 7648 of the markers. A subset of 2795 SNP markers, with an average distance of 0.66 cM between adjacent markers, was applied for QTL mapping of seed colour and the cell wall fiber components acid detergent lignin (ADL), cellulose and hemicellulose. After phenotypic analyses across four different environments a total of 11 QTL were detected for seed colour and fiber traits. The high-density map considerably improved QTL resolution compared to the previous low-density maps. A previously identified major QTL with very high effects on seed colour and ADL was pinpointed to a narrow genome interval on chromosome A09, while a minor QTL explaining 8.1\% to 14.1\% of variation for ADL was detected on chromosome C05. Five and three QTL accounting for 4.7\% to 21.9\% and 7.3\% to 16.9\% of the phenotypic variation for cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, were also detected. To our knowledge this is the first description of QTL for seed cellulose and hemicellulose in B. napus, representing interesting new targets for improving oil content. The high density SNP genetic map enables navigation from interesting B. napus QTL to Brassica genome sequences, giving useful new information for understanding the genetics of key seed quality traits in rapeseed.},

In this study, a high density genetic map was constructed with megagametophytes of 94 seeds from a single Ginkgo tree by employing the specificlocus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing technique. The average sequencing depth was 11.20{\texttimes}, which yielded 538,031 high-quality SLAFs. Among these SLAFs, 204,361 were heterozygous in the maternal tree and segregated in the progeny. The established map contained 12,263 SLAFs that were assigned to 12 linkage groups (LGs). The number of LGs on this map equaled the number of chromosomes in Ginkgo. The total map length was 1,671.77 cM, with an average distance of 0.89 cM between adjacent marker bins. Map evaluation based on the haplotype map and the heat map validated the high quality of the established map. Because Ginkgo is an economically and biologically important tree, strenuous efforts have been exerted to sequence its genome. This new map, built using sequence-based markers, will serve in the future as a fundamental platform for anchoring sequence assemblies along Ginkgo chromosomes. This map also provides a desirable platform for various genetic studies of Ginkgo, including gene/quantitative trait locus mapping and marker-aided selection.},

The approximately one dozen distinct Mu transposons contain highly similar ,215 bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and generate 9-bp target site duplications (TSDs) upon insertion. Using a novel genome walking strategy that uses these conserved TIRs as primer binding sites, Mu insertion sites were amplified from Mu stocks and sequenced via 454 technology. 94\% of ,965,000 reads carried Mu TIRs, demonstrating the specificity of this strategy. Among these TIRs, 21 novel Mu TIRs were discovered, revealing additional complexity of the Mu transposon system. The distribution of .40,000 non-redundant Mu insertion sites was strikingly non-uniform, such that rates increased in proportion to distance from the centromere. An identified putative Mu transposase binding consensus site does not explain this non-uniformity. An integrated genetic map containing more than 10,000 genetic markers was constructed and aligned to the sequence of the maize reference genome. Recombination rates (cM/Mb) are also strikingly non-uniform, with rates increasing in proportion to distance from the centromere. Mu insertion site frequencies are strongly correlated with recombination rates. Gene density does not fully explain the chromosomal distribution of Mu insertion and recombination sites, because pronounced preferences for the distal portion of chromosome are still observed even after accounting for gene density. The similarity of the distributions of Mu insertions and meiotic recombination sites suggests that common features, such as chromatin structure, are involved in site selection for both Mu insertion and meiotic recombination. The finding that Mu insertions and meiotic recombination sites both concentrate in genomic regions marked with epigenetic marks of open chromatin provides support for the hypothesis that open chromatin enhances rates of both Mu insertion and meiotic recombination.},

Abstract                                Meiosis is the basis of sexual reproduction, and its basic progression is conserved across eukaryote kingdoms. A key feature of meiosis is the formation of crossovers which result in the reciprocal exchange of segments of maternal and paternal chromosomes. This exchange generates chromosomes with new combinations of alleles, increasing the efficiency of both natural and artificial selection. Crossovers also form a physical link between homologous chromosomes at metaphase I which is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and fertility. The patterning of crossovers along the length of chromosomes is a highly regulated process, and our current understanding of its regulation forms the focus of this review. At the global scale, crossover patterning in plants is largely governed by the classically observed phenomena of crossover interference, crossover homeostasis and the obligatory crossover which regulate the total number of crossovers and their relative spacing. The molecular actors behind these phenomena have long remained obscure, but recent studies in plants implicate                 HEI10                 and                 ZYP1                 as key players in their coordination. In addition to these broad forces, a wealth of recent studies has highlighted how genomic and epigenomic features shape crossover formation at both chromosomal and local scales, revealing that crossovers are primarily located in open chromatin associated with gene promoters and terminators with low nucleosome occupancy.},

Here, Lloyd and Jenczewski model crossover patterning in Arabidopsis to gain insights into what causes the large differences in recombination rates and patterns...             ``Interference'' is a major force governing the patterning of meiotic crossovers. A leading model describing how interference influences crossover patterning is the beam-film model, a mechanical model based on the accumulation and redistribution of crossover-promoting ``stress'' along the chromosome axis. We use the beam-film model in conjunction with a large Arabidopsis reciprocal backcross data set to gain ``mechanistic'' insights into the differences between male and female meiosis, and crossover patterning. Beam-film modeling suggests that the underlying mechanics of crossover patterning and interference are identical in the two sexes, with the large difference in recombination rates and distributions able to be entirely explained by the shorter chromosome axes in females. The modeling supports previous indications that fewer crossovers occur via the class II pathway in female meiosis and that this could be explained by reduced DNA double-strand breaks in female meiosis, paralleling the observed reduction in synaptonemal complex length between the two sexes. We also demonstrate that changes in the strength of suppression of neighboring class I crossovers can have opposite effects on ``effective'' interference depending on the distance between two genetic intervals.},

It was reported in Drosophila a century ago, that the recombination rate is sensitive to temperature, but how...             Meiotic recombination shuffles genetic information from sexual species into gametes to create novel combinations in offspring. Thus, recombination is an important factor in inheritance, adaptation, and responses to selection. However, recombination is not a static parameter; meiotic recombination rate is sensitive to variation in the environment, especially temperature. That recombination rates change in response to both increases and decreases in temperature was reported in Drosophila a century ago, and since then in several other species. But it is still unclear what the underlying mechanism is, and whether low- and high-temperature effects are mechanistically equivalent. Here, we show that, as in Drosophila, both high and low temperatures increase meiotic crossovers in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that, from a nadir at 18{\textdegree}, both lower and higher temperatures increase recombination through additional class I (interfering) crossovers. However, the increase in crossovers at high and low temperatures appears to be mechanistically at least somewhat distinct, as they differ in their association with the DNA repair protein MLH1. We also find that, in contrast to what has been reported in barley, synaptonemal complex length is negatively correlated with temperature; thus, an increase in chromosome axis length may account for increased crossovers at low temperature in A. thaliana, but cannot explain the increased crossovers observed at high temperature. The plasticity of recombination has important implications for evolution and breeding, and also for the interpretation of observations of recombination rate variation among natural populations.},

  abstract = {Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp.) is a major crop for worldwide food and nutritional security, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, that is resilient to hot and drought-prone environments. An assembly of the singlehaplotype inbred genome of cowpea IT97K-499-35 was developed by exploiting the synergies between single-molecule real-time sequencing, optical and genetic mapping, and an assembly reconciliation algorithm. A total of 519 Mb is included in the assembled sequences. Nearly half of the assembled sequence is composed of repetitive elements, which are enriched within recombination-poor pericentromeric regions. A comparative analysis of these elements suggests that genome size differences between Vigna species are mainly attributable to changes in the amount of Gypsy retrotransposons. Conversely, genes are more abundant in more distal, high-recombination regions of the chromosomes; there appears to be more duplication of genes within the NBS-LRR and the SAUR-like auxin superfamilies compared with other warm-season legumes that have been sequenced. A surprising outcome is the identification of an inversion of 4.2 Mb among landraces and cultivars, which includes a gene that has been associated in other plants with interactions with the parasitic weed Striga gesnerioides. The genome sequence facilitated the identification of a putative syntelog for multiple organ gigantism in legumes. A revised numbering system has been adopted for cowpea chromosomes based on synteny with common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). An estimate of nuclear genome size of 640.6 Mbp based on cytometry is presented.},

Many examples of groups of adapted genes located within inversions are arising in the literature, in part inspired by theory that predicts the evolution of these so-called ``supergenes.'' We still, however, have a poor understanding of how genomic heterogeneity, such as varying rates of recombination, may confound signals of selection. Here, I evaluate the effect of neutral inversions and recombination variation on genome scans for selection, including tests for selective sweeps, differentiation outlier tests, and association tests. There is considerable variation among methods in their performance, with some methods being unaffected and some showing elevated false positive signals within a neutral inversion or region of low recombination. In some cases the false positive signal can be dampened or removed, if it is possible to use a quasi-independent set of SNPs to parameterize the model before performing the test. These results will be helpful to those seeking to understand the importance of regions of low recombination in adaptation.},

Additionally, cis- and trans-regulatory networks are more likely to have opposing effects than expected under neutral evolution, supporting a strong influence of compensatory evolution and stabilizing selection.

Deleterious mutations in both species were prevalent in pericentromeric regions, enriched in non-syntenic genes, and present at low allele frequencies. A comparison of deleterious burden between sorghum and maize revealed that sorghum, in contrast to maize, departed from the ``domestication cost'' hypothesis that predicts a higher deleterious burden among domesticates compared to wild lines. Additionally, sorghum and maize population genetic summary statistics were used to predict a gene deleterious index with an accuracy higher than 0.5. This research represents a key step towards understanding the evolutionary dynamics of deleterious variants in sorghum and provides a comparative genomics framework to start prioritizing them for removal through genome editing and breeding.},

Using whole-genome sequences from across a species' range, we assessed the impact of demographic history and mating system on LD. Both range expansion and a shift from outcrossing to selfing in North American Arabidopsis lyrata were associated with increased average genome-wide LD. Our results indicate that range expansion increases short-distance LD at the farthest range edges by about the same amount as a shift to selfing. However, the extent over which LD in genic regions unfolds was shorter for range expansion compared to selfing. Linkage among putatively neutral variants and between neutral and deleterious variants increased to a similar degree with range expansion, providing support that genome-wide LD was positively associated with mutational load. As a consequence, LD combined with mutational load may decelerate range expansions and set range limits. Finally, a small number of genes were identified as LD outliers, suggesting that they experience selection by either of the two demographic processes. These included genes involved in flowering and photoperiod for range expansion, and the self-incompatibility locus for mating system.},

BEST uses a meiosis-specific GFP fusion protein to isolate tetrads by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and molecular barcodes that are read during genotyping to identify spores derived from the same tetrad. Maintaining tetrad information allows accurate inference of missing genetic markers and full genotypes of missing (and presumably nonviable) individuals. By removing the bottleneck of manual dissection, hundreds or even thousands of tetrads can be isolated in minutes. We demonstrate the approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but BEST is readily transferable to microorganisms in which meiotic mapping is significantly more laborious.},

  abstract = {Repetitive elements are abundantly distributed in mammalian genomes. Here, we reveal a striking association between repeat subtypes and gene function. SINE, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of SINE repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its DNA in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of L1 RNA in ESCs leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and derepression of L1-associated genes. These results demonstrate a role of L1 DNA and RNA in gene silencing and suggest a general theme of genomic repeats in orchestrating the function, regulation, and expression of their host genes.},

  abstract = {Plants of the Dendrobium genus are orchids with not only ornamental value but also high medicinal value. To understand the genetic basis of variations in active ingredients of the stem total polysaccharide contents (STPCs) among different Dendrobium species, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism of STPC formation and identify genes affecting its process at the whole genome level. Here, we report the first high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) integrated genetic map with a good genome coverage of Dendrobium. The specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology led to identification of 7,013,400 SNPs from 1,503,626 high-quality SLAF markers from two parents (Dendrobium moniliforme {\venus} {\texttimes} Dendrobium officinale {\male}) and their interspecific F1 hybrid population. The final genetic map contained 8, 573 SLAF markers, covering 19 linkage groups (LGs). This genetic map spanned a length of 2,737.49 cM, where the average distance between markers is 0.32 cM. In total, 5 quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to STPC were identified, 3 of which have candidate genes within the confidence intervals of these stable QTLs based on the D. officinale genome sequence. This study will build a foundation up for the mapping of other medicinal-related traits and provide an important reference for the molecular breeding of these Chinese herb.},

  abstract = {Several studies have indicated a non- correspondence between genetic and physical distances in wheat chromosomes. To study the physical distribution of recombination, polymorphism for C-banding patterns was used to monitor recombination in 67 segments in 11 B-genome chromosome arms of Triticum turgidum. Recombination was absent in proximal regions of all chromosome arms; its frequency increased exponentially with distance from the centromere. A significant difference was observed between the distribution of recombination in physically short and physically long arms. In physically short arms, recombination was almost exclusively concentrated in distal segments and only those regions were represented in their genetic maps. In physically long arms, while a majority of the genetic distance was again based upon recombination in distal chromosome segments, some interstitial recombination was observed. Consequently, these regions also contributed to the genetic maps. Such a pattern of recombination, skewed toward terminal segments of chromosomes, is probably a result of telomeric pairing initiation and strong positive chiasma interference. Interference averaged 0.81 in 35 pairs of adjacent segments and 0.57 across the entire recombining portions of chromosome arms. The total genetic map lengths of the arms corresponded closely to those expected on the basis of their metaphase-I chiasma frequencies. As a consequence of this uneven distribution of recombination there can be a 153-fold difference (or more) in the number of DNA base pairs per unit (centiMorgan) of genetic length.},

To construct a physical map of the               Ae. tauschii               genome, we fingerprinted 461,706 bacterial artificial chromosome clones, assembled contigs, designed a 10K               Ae. tauschii               Infinium SNP array, constructed a 7,185-marker genetic map, and anchored on the map contigs totaling 4.03 Gb.

We obtained additional information about the evolution of the seven Triticeae chromosomes from 12 ancestral chromosomes and uncovered a pattern of centromere inactivation accompanying nested chromosome insertions in grasses. We showed that the density of noncollinear genes along the               Ae. tauschii               chromosomes positively correlates with recombination rates, suggested a cause, and showed that new genes, exemplified by disease resistance genes, are preferentially located in high-recombination chromosome regions.},

Comparisons of the map with the rice and sorghum genome sequences revealed 50 inversions and translocations; 2, 8, and 40 were assigned respectively to the rice, sorghum, and               Ae. tauschii               lineages, showing greatly accelerated genome evolution in the large Triticeae genomes. The reduction of the basic chromosome number from 12 to 7 in the Triticeae has taken place by a process during which an entire chromosome is inserted by its telomeres into a break in the centromeric region of another chromosome. The original centromere{\textendash}telomere polarity of the chromosome arms is maintained in the new chromosome. An intrachromosomal telomere{\textendash}telomere fusion resulting in a pericentric translocation of a chromosome segment or an entire arm accompanied or preceded the chromosome insertion in some instances. Insertional dysploidy has been recorded in three grass subfamilies and appears to be the dominant mechanism of basic chromosome number reduction in grasses. A total of 64\% and 66\% of               Ae. tauschii               genes were syntenic with sorghum and rice genes, respectively. Synteny was reduced in the vicinity of the termini of modern               Ae. tauschii               chromosomes but not in the vicinity of the ancient termini embedded in the               Ae. tauschii               chromosomes, suggesting that the dependence of synteny erosion on gene location along the centromere{\textendash}telomere axis either evolved recently in the Triticeae phylogenetic lineage or its evolution was recently accelerated.},

  abstract = {Background: Mutations often accompany DNA replication. Since there may be fewer cell cycles per year in the germlines of long-lived than short-lived angiosperms, the genomes of long-lived angiosperms may be diverging more slowly than those of short-lived angiosperms. Here we test this hypothesis. Results: We first constructed a genetic map for walnut, a woody perennial. All linkage groups were short, and recombination rates were greatly reduced in the centromeric regions. We then used the genetic map to construct a walnut bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone-based physical map, which contained 15,203 exonic BAC-end sequences, and quantified with it synteny between the walnut genome and genomes of three long-lived woody perennials, Vitis vinifera, Populus trichocarpa, and Malus domestica, and three short-lived herbs, Cucumis sativus, Medicago truncatula, and Fragaria vesca. Each measure of synteny we used showed that the genomes of woody perennials were less diverged from the walnut genome than those of herbs. We also estimated the nucleotide substitution rate at silent codon positions in the walnut lineage. It was one-fifth and one-sixth of published nucleotide substitution rates in the Medicago and Arabidopsis lineages, respectively. We uncovered a whole-genome duplication in the walnut lineage, dated it to the neighborhood of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, and allocated the 16 walnut chromosomes into eight homoeologous pairs. We pointed out that during polyploidy-dysploidy cycles, the dominant tendency is to reduce the chromosome number. Conclusion: Slow rates of nucleotide substitution are accompanied by slow rates of synteny erosion during genome divergence in woody perennials.},

  abstract = {High-density genetic map is a valuable tool for exploring novel genomic information, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and gene discovery of economically agronomic traits in plant species. However, high-resolution genetic map applied to tag QTLs associated with important traits and to investigate genomic features underlying recombination landscape in radish (Raphanus sativus) remains largely unexplored. In this study, an ultra-high-density genetic map with 378 738 SNPs covering 1306.8 cM in nine radish linkage groups (LGs) was developed by a whole-genome sequencing-based approach. A total of 18 QTLs for 11 horticulture traits were detected. The mapbased cloning data indicated that the R2R3-MYB transcription factor RsMYB90 was a crucial candidate gene determining the taproot skin colour. Comparative genomics analysis among radish, Brassica rapa and B. oleracea genome revealed several genomic rearrangements existed in the radish genome. The highly uneven distribution of recombination was observed across the nine radish chromosomes. Totally, 504 recombination hot regions (RHRs) were enriched near gene promoters and terminators. The recombination rate in RHRs was positively correlated with the density of SNPs and gene, and GC content, respectively. Functional annotation indicated that genes within RHRs were mainly involved in metabolic process and binding. Three QTLs for three traits were found in the RHRs. The results provide novel insights into the radish genome evolution and recombination landscape, and facilitate the development of effective strategies for molecular breeding by targeting and dissecting important traits in radish.},

However, despite these efforts little is known about patterns of meiotic exchange in human germ cells or the mechanisms that control these patterns. Using recently developed immunofluorescence methodology to examine exchanges in human spermatocytes, we have identified remarkable variation in the rate of recombination within and among individuals. Subsequent analyses indicate that, in humans and mice, this variation is linked to differences in the length of the synaptonemal complex. Thus, at least in mammals, a physical structure, the synaptonemal complex, reflects genetic rather than physical distance.},

  abstract = {Consensus linkage maps are important tools in crop genomics. We have assembled a highdensity tetraploid wheat consensus map by integrating 13 data sets from independent biparental populations involving durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum), cultivated emmer (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) and their ancestor (wild emmer, T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides). The consensus map harboured 30 144 markers (including 26 626 SNPs and 791 SSRs) half of which were present in at least two component maps. The final map spanned 2631 cM of all 14 durum wheat chromosomes and, differently from the individual component maps, all markers fell within the 14 linkage groups. Marker density per genetic distance unit peaked at centromeric regions, likely due to a combination of low recombination rate in the centromeric regions and even gene distribution along the chromosomes. Comparisons with bread wheat indicated fewer regions with recombination suppression, making this consensus map valuable for mapping in the A and B genomes of both durum and bread wheat. Sequence similarity analysis allowed us to relate mapped gene-derived SNPs to chromosome-specific transcripts. Dense patterns of homeologous relationships have been established between the A- and B-genome maps and between nonsyntenic homeologous chromosome regions as well, the latter tracing to ancient translocation events. The gene-based homeologous relationships are valuable to infer the map location of homeologs of target loci/QTLs. Because most SNP and SSR markers were previously mapped in bread wheat, this consensus map will facilitate a more effective integration and exploitation of genes and QTL for wheat breeding purposes.},

However, comparative studies have consistently failed to find any strong correlation between measures of census population size and genetic diversity. Instead, a recent comparative study across several animal phyla identified propagule size as the strongest predictor of genetic diversity, suggesting that r-strategists that produce many offspring but invest little in each, have greater long-term effective population sizes. We present a comparison of genome-wide levels of genetic diversity across 38 species of European butterflies (Papilionoidea). We show that across butterflies, genetic diversity varies over an order of magnitude and that this variation cannot be explained by differences in abundance, fecundity, host plant use or geographic range. Instead, we find that genetic diversity is negatively correlated with body size and positively with the length of the genetic map. This suggests that variation in genetic diversity is determined both by fluctuation in                            N               e                          and the effect of selection on linked neutral sites.},

Although this phenomenon is widespread throughout taxa, the mechanisms that lead to heterochiasmy remain unclear. One pattern that has emerged is that the overall length of the synaptonemal complex likely has a direct influence on the total number of crossovers in each sex. However, this has only been investigated in a handful of species. The threespine stickleback fish (             Gasterosteus aculeatus             ) is an excellent species to explore whether synaptonemal complex length is associated with differences in the total number of crossovers, as females have much longer linkage maps than males. We used an immunocytological approach to quantify synaptonemal complex length in late pachytene female and male meiocytes in two different populations of threespine stickleback fish. Overall, the freshwater population had shorter synaptonemal complex lengths than the marine population. In both populations we observed sexual dimorphism, with females possessing longer axes. Our results support a model where chromosome axis length determines overall crossover frequency and establish the threespine stickleback as a useful species to explore the mechanistic basis of heterochiasmy as well as the genetic basis underlying variation in synaptonemal complex length.},

  abstract = {Background: Marker-assisted breeding is now routinely used in major crops to facilitate more efficient cultivar improvement. This has been significantly enabled by the use of next-generation sequencing technology to identify loci and markers associated with traits of interest. While rich in a range of nutritional components, such as protein, mineral nutrients, carbohydrates and several vitamins, pea (Pisum sativum L.), one of the oldest domesticated crops in the world, remains behind many other crops in the availability of genomic and genetic resources. To further improve mineral nutrient levels in pea seeds requires the development of genome-wide tools. The objectives of this research were to develop these tools by: identifying genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genotyping by sequencing (GBS); constructing a high-density linkage map and comparative maps with other legumes, and identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for levels of boron, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorous, sulfur, and zinc in the seed, as well as for seed weight. Results: In this study, 1609 high quality SNPs were found to be polymorphic between `Kiflica' and `Aragorn', two parents of an F6-derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Mapping 1683 markers including 75 previously published markers and 1608 SNPs developed from the present study generated a linkage map of size 1310.1 cM. Comparative mapping with other legumes demonstrated that the highest level of synteny was observed between pea and the genome of Medicago truncatula. QTL analysis of the RIL population across two locations revealed at least one QTL for each of the mineral nutrient traits. In total, 46 seed mineral concentration QTLs, 37 seed mineral content QTLs, and 6 seed weight QTLs were discovered. The QTLs explained from 2.4\% to 43.3\% of the phenotypic variance. Conclusion: The genome-wide SNPs and the genetic linkage map developed in this study permitted QTL identification for pea seed mineral nutrients that will serve as important resources to enable marker-assisted selection (MAS) for nutritional quality traits in pea breeding programs.},

Towards identifying and utilizing favourable alleles from               O. nivara               , we developed a set of introgression lines (ILs) by introducing               O. nivara               segments into the elite               indica               rice variety 93-11 background through advanced backcrossing and repeated selfing. Using whole-genome resequencing, a high-density genetic map containing 1,070 bin-markers was constructed for the 131 ILs, with an average length of 349\,kb per bin. The 131 ILs cover 95\% of               O. nivara               genome, providing a relatively complete genomic library for introgressing               O. nivara               alleles for trait improvement.

This admixture generated the so-called international wine grapes that have diffused from Alpine countries worldwide. Across Europe, marked differences in genomic diversity are observed in local varieties that are traditionally cultivated in different wine producing countries, with Italy and France showing the largest diversity. Three genomic regions of reduced genetic diversity are observed, presumably as a consequence of artificial selection. In the lowest diversity region, two candidate genes that gained berry{\textendash}specific expression in domesticated varieties may contribute to the change in berry size and morphology that makes the fruit attractive for human consumption and adapted for winemaking.},

  abstract = {We have created a high-resolution linkage map of Miscanthus sinensis, using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), identifying all 19 linkage groups for the first time. The result is technically significant since Miscanthus has a very large and highly heterozygous genome, but has no or limited genomics information to date. The composite linkage map containing markers from both parental linkage maps is composed of 3,745 SNP markers spanning 2,396 cM on 19 linkage groups with a 0.64 cM average resolution. Comparative genomics analyses of the M. sinensis composite linkage map to the genomes of sorghum, maize, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon indicate that sorghum has the closest syntenic relationship to Miscanthus compared to other species. The comparative results revealed that each pair of the 19 M. sinensis linkages aligned to one sorghum chromosome, except for LG8, which mapped to two sorghum chromosomes (4 and 7), presumably due to a chromosome fusion event after genome duplication. The data also revealed several other chromosome rearrangements relative to sorghum, including two telomere-centromere inversions of the sorghum syntenic chromosome 7 in LG8 of M. sinensis and two paracentric inversions of sorghum syntenic chromosome 4 in LG7 and LG8 of M. sinensis. The results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the diploid M. sinensis is tetraploid origin consisting of two sub-genomes. This complete and high resolution composite linkage map will not only serve as a useful resource for novel QTL discoveries, but also enable informed deployment of the wealth of existing genomics resources of other species to the improvement of Miscanthus as a high biomass energy crop. In addition, it has utility as a reference for genome sequence assembly for the forthcoming whole genome sequencing of the Miscanthus genus.},

  abstract = {Centromeric DNA evolves rapidly, ranging in size and complexity over several orders of magnitude. Traditional attempts at studying centromeres have left unexplained the causes underlying this complexity and rapid evolution. Instead of directly studying centromeric DNA sequence, our approach has been to study the proteins that epigenetically determine centromere identity. We have discovered that centromeric histones (CenH3s) have evolved under positive selection in multiple lineages, suggesting an involvement in recurrent genetic conflict. Our hypothesis is that `centromere-drive' is the source of this conflict. Under this model, centromeres compete via microtubule attachments for preferential transmission in female meioses occurring in animals and plants. Since only one of four meiotic products will become the egg, this competition confers a selfish advantage to chromosomes that can make more microtubule attachments, resulting in runaway expansions of centromeric satellites. While beneficial to the `driving' chromosome, these expansions can have deleterious effects on the fitness of an organism and of the species. CenH3s as well as other heterochromatin proteins have evolved under positive selection to suppress the deleterious consequences of `centromere-drive' by restoring meiotic parity.},

Crossover interference was detected in all intervals as measured by a reduced number of nonparental ditypes. We have evaluated interference between crossovers in adjacent intervals by methods that retain the information contained in tetrads as opposed to single segregants. Interference was seen between intervals when the distance in the region adjacent to a crossover was \&lt;{$\sim$}35 cM (90 kb). At the met13 locus, which exhibits {$\sim$}9\% gene conversions, those gene conversions accompanied by crossing over exerted interference in exchanges in an adjacent interval, whereas met13 gene conversions without an accompanying exchange did not show interference. The pattern of exchanges along this chromosome arm can be represented by a counting model in which there are three nonexchange events between adjacent exchanges; however, maximum-likelihood analysis suggests that {$\sim$}8{\textendash}12\% of the crossovers on chromosome VII arise by a separate, noninterfering mechanism.},

As such, samples representative of global germplasm pools need to be assessed for existing population structure, diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Complexity reduction genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) methods, including GBS-transcriptomics (GBS-t), enable cost-effective screening of a large number of samples, while whole genome re-sequencing (WGR) delivers the ability to generate large numbers of unbiased genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identify structural variants (SVs). Furthermore, the development of genomic tools based on whole genomes representative of global oilseed diversity and orientated by the reference genome has substantial industry relevance and will be highly beneficial for canola breeding. As recent studies have focused on European and Chinese varieties, a global diversity panel as well as a substantial number of Australian spring types were included in this study. Focusing on industry relevance, 633 varieties were initially genotyped using GBS-t to examine population structure using 61,037 SNPs. Subsequently, 149 samples representative of global diversity were selected for WGR and both data sets used for a side-by-side evaluation of diversity and LD. The WGR data was further used to develop genomic resources consisting of a list of 4,029,750 high-confidence SNPs annotated using SnpEff, and SVs in the form of 10,976 deletions and 2,556 insertions. These resources form the basis of a reliable and repeatable system allowing greater integration between canola genomics studies, with a strong focus on breeding germplasm and industry applicability.},

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the base composition and recombination rate in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Because of a current debate about the accuracy of the estimates of recombination rate in Drosophila, we used eight different measures of recombination rate from recent work. We confirmed that the G+C content of large introns and flanking regions is positively correlated with recombination rate, suggesting that recombination has a neutral effect on base composition in Drosophila. We also confirmed that this neutral effect of recombination is the main determinant of the correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and recombination rate in Drosophila.},

In highly self-fertilizing species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, however, heterozygosity is expected to be strongly reduced and recombination will be much less effective, so that its influence on genome organization should be greatly reduced. Results: Here we investigated theoretically the joint effects of recombination and self-fertilization on base composition, and tested the predictions with genomic data from the complete A. thaliana genome. We show that, in this species, both codon-usage bias and GC content do not correlate with the local rates of crossing over, in agreement with our theoretical results. Conclusions: We conclude that levels of inbreeding modulate the effect of recombination on base composition, and possibly other genomic features (for example, transposable element dynamics). We argue that inbreeding should be considered when interpreting patterns of molecular evolution.},

  abstract = {Background: Meiotic recombination is the foundation for genetic variation in natural and artificial populations of eukaryotes. Although genetic maps have been developed for numerous plant species since the late 1980s, few of these maps have provided the necessary resolution needed to investigate the genomic and epigenomic features underlying meiotic crossovers. Results: Using a whole genome sequencing-based approach, we developed two high-density reference-based haplotype maps using diploid potato clones as parents. The vast majority (81\%) of meiotic crossovers were mapped to less than 5 kb. The fine-scale accuracy of crossover detection was validated by Sanger sequencing for a subset of ten crossover events. We demonstrate that crossovers reside in genomic regions of ``open chromatin'', which were identified based on hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion and association with H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes. The genomic regions spanning crossovers were significantly enriched with the Stowaway family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). The occupancy of Stowaway elements in gene promoters is concomitant with an increase in recombination rate. A generalized linear model identified the presence of Stowaway elements as the third most important genomic or chromatin feature behind genes and open chromatin for predicting crossover formation over 10-kb windows. Conclusions: Collectively, our results suggest that meiotic crossovers in potato are largely determined by the local chromatin status, marked by accessible chromatin, H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes, and the presence of Stowaway transposons.},

  abstract = {Background: Variations in recombination fraction ({\texttheta}) among chromosomal regions, individuals and families have been observed and have an important impact on quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies. Such variations on porcine chromosome X (SSC-X) and on other mammalian chromosome X are rarely explored. The emerging assembly of pig sequence provides exact physical location of many markers, facilitating the study of a fine-scale recombination landscape of the pig genome by comparing a clone-based physical map to a genetic map. Using large offspring of F1 females from two large-scale resource populations (Large White {\male} {\texttimes} Chinese Meishan {\venus}, and White Duroc {\male} {\texttimes} Chinese Erhualian {\venus}), we were able to evaluate the heterogeneity in {\texttheta} for a specific interval among individual F1 females. Results: Alignments between the cytogenetic map, radiation hybrid (RH) map, genetic maps and clone map of SSC-X with the physical map of human chromosome X (HSA-X) are presented. The most likely order of 60 markers on SSC-X is inferred. The average recombination rate across SSC-X is of {\textasciitilde}1.27 cM/Mb. However, almost no recombination occurred in a large region of {\textasciitilde}31 Mb extending from the centromere to Xq21, whereas in the surrounding regions and in the Xq telomeric region a recombination rate of 2.8-3.3 cM/Mb was observed, more than twice the chromosome-wide average rate. Significant differences in {\texttheta} among F1 females within each population were observed for several chromosomal intervals. The largest variation was observed in both populations in the interval UMNP71-SW1943, or more precisely in the subinterval UMNP891-UMNP93. The individual variation in {\texttheta} over this subinterval was found associated with F1 females' maternal haplotypes (Chinese pig haplotypes) and independent of paternal haplotype (European pig haplotypes). The {\texttheta} between UMNP891 and UMNP93 for haplotype 1122 and 4311 differed by more than fourteen-fold (10.3\% vs. 0.7\%). Conclusions: This study reveals marked regional, individual and haplotype-specific differences in recombination rate on SSC-X. Lack of recombination in such a large region makes it impossible to narrow QTL interval using traditional fine-mapping approaches. The relationship between recombination variation and haplotype polymorphism is shown for the first time in pigs.},

  abstract = {Holocentric chromosomes lack a primary constriction, in contrast to monocentrics. They form kinetochores distributed along almost the entire poleward surface of the chromatids, to which spindle fibers attach. No centromere-specific DNA sequence has been found for any holocentric organism studied so far. It was proposed that centromeric repeats, typical for many monocentric species, could not occur in holocentrics, most likely because of differences in the centromere organization. Here we show that the holokinetic centromeres of the Cyperaceae               Rhynchospora pubera               are highly enriched by a centromeric histone H3 variant-interacting centromere-specific satellite family designated ``Tyba'' and by centromeric retrotransposons (i.e., CRRh) occurring as genome-wide interspersed arrays. Centromeric arrays vary in length from 3 to 16 kb and are intermingled with gene-coding sequences and transposable elements. We show that holocentromeres of metaphase chromosomes are composed of multiple centromeric units rather than possessing a diffuse organization, thus favoring the polycentric model. A cell-cycle{\textendash}dependent shuffling of multiple centromeric units results in the formation of functional (poly)centromeres during mitosis. The genome-wide distribution of centromeric repeat arrays interspersing the euchromatin provides a previously unidentified type of centromeric chromatin organization among eukaryotes. Thus, different types of holocentromeres exist in different species, namely with and without centromeric repetitive sequences.},

  abstract = {A strong correlation between GC content and recombination rate is observed in many eukaryotes, which is thought to be due to conversion events linked to the repair of meiotic double-strand breaks. In several organisms, the length of conversion tracts has been shown to decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the sites of meiotic doublestrand breaks. I show here that this behavior leads to a simple analytical model for the evolution and the equilibrium state of the GC content of sequences devoid of meiotic double-strand break sites. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic double-strand breaks are practically excluded from protein-coding sequences. A good fit was observed between the predictions of the model and the variations of the average GC content of the third codon position (GC3) of S. cerevisiae genes. Moreover, recombination parameters that can be extracted by fitting the data to the model coincide with experimentally determined values. These results thus indicate that meiotic recombination plays an important part in determining the fluctuations of GC content in yeast coding sequences. The model also accounted for the different patterns of GC variations observed in the genes of Candida species that exhibit a variety of sexual lifestyles, and hence a wide range of meiotic recombination rates. Finally, the variations of the average GC3 content of human and chicken coding sequences could also be fitted by the model. These results suggest the existence of a widespread pattern of GC variation in eukaryotic genes due to meiotic recombination, which would imply the generality of two features of meiotic recombination: its association with GC-biased gene conversion and the quasi-exclusion of meiotic double-strand breaks from coding sequences. Moreover, the model points out to specific constraints on protein fragments encoded by exon terminal sequences, which are the most affected by the GC bias.},

Recombination initiates with an excess number of double-strand breaks made by Spo11 protein. Thus, crossover control involves a decision by which some breaks give crossovers while others follow a predominantly noncrossover pathway(s). To understand this decision, we examined recombination when breaks are reduced in yeast spo11 hypomorphs. We find that crossover levels tend to be maintained at the expense of noncrossovers and that genomic loci differ in expression of this ``crossover homeostasis.'' These findings define a previously unsuspected manifestation of crossover control, i.e., that the crossover/noncrossover ratio can change to maintain crossovers. Our results distinguish between existing models of crossover control and support the hypothesis that an obligate crossover is a genetically programmed event tied to crossover interference.},

  abstract = {Hybridisation and introgression can dramatically alter the relationships among groups of species, leading to phylogenetic discordance across the genome and between populations. Introgression can also erode species differences over time, but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain postmating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate, which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here, we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene (mel), H. cydno (cyd), and H. timareta (tim), using whole genomes of 92 individuals, and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions, we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic, with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition, long chromosomes, which have lower recombination rates, produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally, we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes, which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers. Our findings illustrate how the combined effects of hybridisation, recombination, and natural selection, acting at multitudes of loci over long periods, can dramatically sculpt the phylogenetic relationships among species.},

The high density of repetitive elements in these regions makes sequence assembly problematic, especially when using short-read sequencing technologies. It can also be difficult to distinguish between active and recently extinct centromeres through sequence analysis. An effective solution is to identify genetically active centromeres (functional in meiosis) by half-tetrad analysis. This genetic approach involves detecting heterozygosity along chromosomes in segregating populations derived from gametes (half-tetrads). Unreduced gametes produced by first division restitution mechanisms comprise complete sets of nonsister chromatids. Along these chromatids, heterozygosity is maximal at the centromeres, and homologous recombination events result in homozygosity toward the telomeres. We genotyped populations of half-tetrad-derived individuals (from Brassica interspecific hybrids) using a high-density array of physically anchored SNP markers (Illumina Brassica 60K Infinium array). Mapping the distribution of heterozygosity in these half-tetrad individuals allowed the genetic mapping of all 19 centromeres of the Brassica A and C genomes to the reference Brassica napus genome. Gene and transposable element density across the B. napus genome were also assessed and corresponded well to previously reported genetic map positions. Known centromerespecific sequences were located in the reference genome, but mostly matched unanchored sequences, suggesting that the core centromeric regions may not yet be assembled into the pseudochromosomes of the reference genome. The increasing availability of genetic markers physically anchored to reference genomes greatly simplifies the genetic and physical mapping of centromeres using half-tetrad analysis. We discuss possible applications of this approach, including in species where half-tetrads are currently difficult to isolate.},

We genotyped populations of half-tetrad-derived individuals (from Brassica interspecific hybrids) using a high-density array of physically anchored SNP markers (Illumina Brassica 60K Infinium array). Mapping the distribution of heterozygosity in these half-tetrad individuals allowed the genetic mapping of all 19 centromeres of the Brassica A and C genomes to the reference Brassica napus genome. Gene and transposable element density across the B. napus genome were also assessed and corresponded well to previously reported genetic map positions. Known centromerespecific sequences were located in the reference genome, but mostly matched unanchored sequences, suggesting that the core centromeric regions may not yet be assembled into the pseudochromosomes of the reference genome. The increasing availability of genetic markers physically anchored to reference genomes greatly simplifies the genetic and physical mapping of centromeres using half-tetrad analysis. We discuss possible applications of this approach, including in species where half-tetrads are currently difficult to isolate.},

These ``Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities'' (DMIs) are predicted to accumulate at a rate faster than linear as the number of incompatible gene interactions ``snowballs''. Here we show that this snowball prediction is an artifact of two unrealistic modeling assumptions that stem from ignoring demography. We introduce a new alternative ``demographic speciation model'' in which the rate of DMI accumulation between populations is affected by the efficiency of purifying selection to remove incompatibilities that arise within populations. This model yields new testable predictions for understanding the tempo and mode of speciation based on population demographic parameters. A large-scale empirical analysis of bird and mammal datasets supports a unique prediction of our model: a negative relationship between effective population sizes and speciation rates. Our results challenge views of the snowball theory, and of ecological speciation models rooted in positive selection, showing instead that purifying selection may play a major role in mediating speciation rates.},

We show that the barley (H) genome displays a mosaic of structural similarity to hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) A, B, and D subgenomes and that orthologous genes in different grasses exhibit signatures of positive selection in different lineages. We present an ordered, information-rich scaffold of the barley genome that provides a valuable and robust framework for the development of novel strategies in cereal breeding.},

  abstract = {Chromosome numbers have been widely used to describe the most fundamental genomic attribute of an organism or a lineage. While providing strong phylogenetic signal, chromosome numbers vary remarkably among eukaryotes at all levels of taxonomic resolution. Changes in chromosome numbers regularly serve as indication of major genomic events, most notably polyploidy and dysploidy. Here, we review recent advancements in our ability to make inferences regarding historical events that led to alterations in the number of chromosomes of a lineage. We first describe the mechanistic processes underlying changes in chromosome numbers, focusing on structural chromosomal rearrangements. Then, we focus on experimental procedures, encompassing comparative cytogenomics and genomics approaches, and on computational methodologies that are based on explicit models of chromosome-number evolution. Together, these tools offer valuable predictions regarding historical events that have changed chromosome numbers and genome structures, as well as their phylogenetic and temporal placements.},

To address the demand, plant breeders seek new sources of genetic variation to enhance the productivity, sustainability and resilience of crop varieties. Here we launch a high-resolution, open-access research platform to facilitate genome-wide association mapping in rice, a staple food crop. The platform provides an immortal collection of diverse germplasm, a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism data set tailored for gene discovery, well-documented analytical strategies, and a suite of bioinformatics resources to facilitate biological interpretation. Using grain length, we demonstrate the power and resolution of our new high-density rice array, the accompanying genotypic data set, and an expanded diversity panel for detecting major and minor effect QTLs and subpopulation-specific alleles, with immediate implications for rice improvement.},

  abstract = {One of the most influential observations in molecular evolution has been a strong association between local recombination rate and nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. This is interpreted as evidence for ubiquitous natural selection. The alternative explanation, that recombination is mutagenic, has been rejected by the absence of a similar association between local recombination rate and nucleotide divergence between species. However, many recent studies show that recombination rates are often very different even in closely related species, questioning whether an association between recombination rate and divergence between species has been tested satisfactorily. To circumvent this problem, we directly surveyed recombination across approximately 43\% of the D. pseudoobscura physical genome in two separate recombination maps and 31\% of the D. miranda physical genome, and we identified both global and local differences in recombination rate between these two closely related species. Using only regions with conserved recombination rates between and within species and accounting for multiple covariates, our data support the conclusion that recombination is positively related to diversity because recombination modulates Hill{\textendash}Robertson effects in the genome and not because recombination is predominately mutagenic. Finally, we find evidence for dips in diversity around nonsynonymous substitutions. We infer that at least some of this reduction in diversity resulted from selective sweeps and examine these dips in the context of recombination rate.},

The mechanisms for connecting sister chromatids and homologs during meiosis are highly conserved and include specialized forms of the cohesin complex and a tightly regulated homolog synapsis/recombination pathway designed to yield regular crossovers between homologous chromatids. Drosophila male meiosis is of special interest because it dispenses with large segments of the standard meiotic script, particularly recombination, synapsis and the associated structures. Instead, Drosophila relies on a unique protein complex composed of at least two novel proteins, SNM and MNM, to provide stable connections between homologs during meiosis I. Sister chromatid cohesion in Drosophila is mediated by cohesins, ring-shaped complexes that entrap sister chromatids. However, unlike other eukaryotes Drosophila does not rely on the highly conserved Rec8 cohesin in meiosis, but instead utilizes two novel cohesion proteins, ORD and SOLO, which interact with the SMC1/3 cohesin components in providing meiotic cohesion.},

  abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson (2001) has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4Ner, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial DNA. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both HIV1 and HIV2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

Interference causes the frequency distribution of segregating sites to resemble that expected from more weakly selected mutations and also generates specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium.

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental biological process that plays a central role in the evolution and breeding of plants. We have developed a new seed-based assay for meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis. The assay is based on the transformation of green and red fluorescent markers expressed under a seed-specific promoter. A total of 74 T-DNA markers were isolated, sequenced and mapped both physically and genetically. Lines containing red and green markers that map 1{\textendash}20 cM apart were crossed to produce tester lines with the two markers linked in cis yielding seeds that fluoresced both in red and green. We show that these lines can be used for efficient scoring of recombinant types (red only or green only fluorescing seeds) in a seed population derived from a test cross (backcross) or self-pollination. Two tester lines that were characterized during several generations of backcross and self-pollination, one in the background of ecotype Landsberg and one in the ecotype Columbia, are described. We discuss the number of plants and seeds to be scored in order to obtain reliable and reproducible crossing over rate values. This assay offers a relatively high-throughput method, with the benefit of seed markers (similar to the maize classical genetic markers) combined with the advantages of Arabidopsis. It advances the prospect to better understand the factors that affect the rate of meiotic crossover in plants and to stimulate this process for more efficient breeding and mapping.},

  abstract = {Background: Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation, yet their DNA sequences evolve rapidly. In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. Results: Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA, which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution. Conclusions: While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Crossovers are essential for the completion of meiosis. Recently, two pathways of crossover formation have been identified on the basis of distinct genetic controls. In one pathway, crossover inhibits the occurrence of another such event in a distance-dependent manner. This phenomenon is known as interference. The second kind of crossover is insensitive to interference. The two pathways function independently in budding yeast. Only interference-insensitive crossovers occur in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In contrast, only interference-sensitive crossovers occur in Caenorabditis elegans. The situation in mammals and plants remains unclear. Mer3 is one of the genes shown to be required for the formation of interference-sensitive crossovers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results: To unravel the crossover status in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we investigated the role of the A. thaliana MER3 gene through the characterization of a series of allelic mutants. All mer3 mutants showed low levels of fertility and a significant decrease (about 75\%) but not a total disappearance of meiotic crossovers, with the number of recombination events initiated in the mutants being similar to that in the wild-type. Genetic analyses showed that the residual crossovers in mer3 mutants did not display interference in one set of adjacent intervals. Conclusions: Mutation in MER3 in Arabidopsis appeared to be specific to recombination events resulting in interference-sensitive crossovers. Thus, MER3 function is conserved from yeast to plants and may exist in other metazoans. Arabidopsis therefore has at least two pathways for crossover formation, one giving rise to interference-sensitive crossover and the other to independently distributed crossovers.},

  abstract = {Coffee species such as Coffea canephora P. (Robusta) and C. arabica L. (Arabica) are important cash crops in tropical regions around the world. C. arabica is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 44) originating from a hybridization event of the two diploid species C. canephora and C. eugenioides (2n = 2x = 22). Interestingly, these progenitor species harbour a greater level of genetic variability and are an important source of genes to broaden the narrow Arabica genetic base. Here, we describe the development, evaluation and use of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for coffee trees. A total of 8580 unique and informative SNPs were selected from C. canephora and C. arabica sequencing data, with 40\% of the SNP located in annotated genes. In particular, this array contains 227 markers associated to 149 genes and traits of agronomic importance. Among these, 7065 SNPs ({\textasciitilde}82.3\%) were scorable and evenly distributed over the genome with a mean distance of 54.4 Kb between markers. With this array, we improved the Robusta high-density genetic map by adding 1307 SNP markers, whereas 945 SNPs were found segregating in the Arabica mapping progeny. A panel of C. canephora accessions was successfully discriminated and over 70\% of the SNP markers were transferable across the three species. Furthermore, the canephora-derived subgenome of C. arabica was shown to be more closely related to C. canephora accessions from northern Uganda than to other current populations. These validated SNP markers and high-density genetic maps will be useful to molecular genetics and for innovative approaches in coffee breeding.},

  abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that the distribution of meiotic crossover events along chromosomes is non-random in plants and other species with sexual reproduction. Large differences in recombination frequencies appear at several scales. On a large scale, regions of high and low rates of crossover have been found to alternate along the chromosomes in all plant species studied. High crossover rates have been reported to be correlated with several chromosome features (e.g. gene density and distance to the centromeres). However, most of these correlations cannot be extended to all plant species. Only a few plant species have been studied on a finer scale. Hotspots of meiotic recombination (i.e. DNA fragments of a few kilobases in length with a higher rate of recombination than the surrounding DNA) have been identified in maize and rice. Most of these hotspots are intragenic. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have identified several DNA fragments (less than 5 kb in size) with genetic recombination rates at least 5 times higher than the whole-chromosome average [4.6 cM (centimorgan)/Mb], which are therefore probable hotspots for meiotic recombination. Most crossover breakpoints lie in intergenic or non-coding regions. Major efforts should be devoted to characterizing meiotic recombination at the molecular level, which should help to clarify the role of this process in genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Spirodela polyrhiza is a fast-growing aquatic monocot with highly reduced morphology, genome size and number of protein-coding genes. Considering these biological features of Spirodela and its basal position in the monocot lineage, understanding its genome architecture could shed light on plant adaptation and genome evolution. Like many draft genomes, however, the 158-Mb Spirodela genome sequence has not been resolved to chromosomes, and important genome characteristics have not been defined. Here we deployed rapid genome-wide physical maps combined with high-coverage short-read sequencing to resolve the 20 chromosomes of Spirodela and to empirically delineate its genome features. Our data revealed a dramatic reduction in the number of the rDNA repeat units in Spirodela to fewer than 100, which is even fewer than that reported for yeast. Consistent with its unique phylogenetic position, small RNA sequencing revealed 29 Spirodela-specific microRNA, with only two being shared with Elaeis guineensis (oil palm) and Musa balbisiana (banana). Combining DNA methylation data and small RNA sequencing enabled the accurate prediction of 20.5\% long terminal repeats (LTRs) that doubled the previous estimate, and revealed a high Solo:Intact LTR ratio of 8.2. Interestingly, we found that Spirodela has the lowest global DNA methylation levels (9\%) of any plant species tested. Taken together our results reveal a genome that has undergone reduction, likely through eliminating nonessential protein coding genes, rDNA and LTRs. In addition to delineating the genome features of this unique plant, the methodologies described and large-scale genome resources from this work will enable future evolutionary and functional studies of this basal monocot family.},

Like many hybrids, the AD hybrids are largely locked at the F1 stage and are mostly unable to undergo normal meiotic reproduction. However, these F1 hybrids, which display a high ({$\sim$}10\%) sequence divergence are known to genetically diversify through mitotic recombination and aneuploidy, and this diversification may be adaptive. In this study, we evolved a single AD hybrid genotype to six diverse environments by serial passaging and then used genome resequencing of evolved clones to determine evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation. The evolved clones generally increased fitness after passaging, accompanied by an average of 3.3 point mutations and 2.9 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events per clone. LOH occurred through nondisjunction of chromosomes, crossing over consistent with break-induced replication, and gene conversion, in that order of prevalence. The breakpoints of these recombination events were significantly associated with regions of the genome with lower sequence divergence between the parents and clustered in subtelomeric regions, notably in regions that had undergone introgression between the two parental species. Parallel evolution was observed, particularly through repeated homozygosity via nondisjunction, yet there was little evidence of environment-specific parallel change for either LOH, aneuploidy, or mutations. These data show that AD hybrids have both a remarkable genomic plasticity and yet are challenged in the ability to recombine through sequence divergence and chromosomal rearrangements, a scenario likely limiting the precision of adaptive evolution to novel environments.},

The temporal and spatial expression of the two proteins were similar in wild-type rye, but with one notable difference. Unlike A. thaliana, in which foci of the transverse filament protein Zyp1 appear to linearize commensurately with synapsis, linear tracts of Asy1 and Zyp1 protein form independently at leptotene and early zygotene of rye and coalign into triple structures resembling synaptonemal complexes (SCs) only at later stages of synapsis. The sy10 mutant used in this study also forms spatially separate linear tracts of Asy1 and Zyp1 proteins at leptotene and early zygotene, and these coalign but do not form regular triple structures at midprophase. Electron microscopy of spread axial elements reveals extensive asynapsis with some exchanges of pairing partners. Indiscriminate SCs support nonhomologous chiasma formation at metaphase I, as revealed by multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization enabling reliable identification of all the chromosomes of the complement. Scrutiny of chiasmate associations of chromosomes at this stage revealed some specificity in the associations of homologous and nonhomologous chromosomes. Inferences about the nature of synapsis in this mutant were drawn from such observations.},

The aim of this study was to create a highly saturated, multilocus linkage map of rye via consensus mapping, based on Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. Methodology/Principal Findings: Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from 5 populations (564 in total) were genotyped using DArT markers and subjected to linkage analysis using Join Map 4.0 and Multipoint Consensus 2.2 software. A consensus map was constructed using a total of 9703 segregating markers. The average chromosome map length ranged from 199.9 cM (2R) to 251.4 cM (4R) and the average map density was 1.1 cM. The integrated map comprised 4048 loci with the number of markers per chromosome ranging from 454 for 7R to 805 for 4R. In comparison with previously published studies on rye, this represents an eight-fold increase in the number of loci placed on a consensus map and a more than two-fold increase in the number of genetically mapped DArT markers. Conclusions/Significance: Through the careful choice of marker type, mapping populations and the use of software packages implementing powerful algorithms for map order optimization, we produced a valuable resource for rye and triticale genomics and breeding, which provides an excellent starting point for more in-depth studies on rye genome organization.},

  abstract = {Killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) are widely distributed among different aquatic environments where they demonstrate an impressive range of highly-plastic and locally adaptive phenotypes. Highthroughput sequencing has begun to unravel the mechanisms and evolutionary history of these interesting features by establishing relationships in the genotype-phenotype map. However, some genotype-phenotype analyses require a higher order of contiguity than what initial scaffolded (fragmented genome assembly where contigs have been assemble into scaffolds) genome assemblies can provide. Here, we used 5,685 high-quality RAD-Seq markers from a single mapping family to order 84\% of the scaffolded genome assembly to 24 chromosomes. This serves to: 1) expand the killifish genomic toolkit, 2) estimate genome-wide recombination rates, and 3) compare genome synteny to humans and other fishes. After initially building our map, we found that the selection of thresholds for sequence data filtration highly impacted scaffold placement in the map. We outline each step of the approach that dramatically improved our map to help guide others toward more effective linkage mapping for genome assembly. Our final map supports strong conservation of genomic synteny among closely related fish species and reveals previously described chromosomal rearrangements between more distantly related clades. However, we also commonly found minor scaffold misorientations in F. heteroclitus and in other assemblies, suggesting that further mapping (such as optical mapping) is necessary for finer scale resolution of genome structure. Lastly, we discuss the problems that would be expected from misoriented/ unplaced scaffolds and stress the importance of a quality mapped genome as a key feature for further investigating population and comparative genomic questions with F. heteroclitus and other taxa.},

  abstract = {Several distinct DNA fragments were subcloned from a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) bacterial artificial chromosome clone 13I16 that was derived from a centromere. Three fragments showed significant sequence identity to either Ty3/gypsy- or Ty1/copia-like retrotransposons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the Ty1/copia-related DNA sequences are not specific to the centromeric regions. However, the Ty3/gypsy-related sequences were present exclusively in the centromeres of all sorghum chromosomes. FISH and gel-blot hybridization showed that these sequences are also conserved in the centromeric regions of all species within Gramineae. Thus, we report a new retrotransposon that is conserved in specific chromosomal regions of distantly related eukaryotic species. We propose that the Ty3/gypsy-like retrotransposons in the grass centromeres may be ancient insertions and are likely to have been amplified during centromere evolution. The possible role of centromeric retrotransposons in plant centromere function is discussed.},

  abstract = {A century of genetic analysis has revealed that multiple mechanisms control the distribution of meiotic crossover events. In Drosophila melanogaster, two significant positional controls are interference and the strongly polar centromere effect. Here, we assess the factors controlling the distribution of crossovers (COs) and noncrossover gene conversions (NCOs) along all five major chromosome arms in 196 single meiotic divisions to generate a more detailed understanding of these controls on a genome-wide scale. Analyzing the outcomes of single meiotic events allows us to distinguish among different classes of meiotic recombination. In so doing, we identified 291 NCOs spread uniformly among the five major chromosome arms and 541 COs (including 52 double crossovers and one triple crossover). We find that unlike COs, NCOs are insensitive to the centromere effect and do not demonstrate interference. Although the positions of COs appear to be determined predominately by the long-range influences of interference and the centromere effect, each chromosome may display a different pattern of sensitivity to interference, suggesting that interference may not be a uniform global property. In addition, unbiased sequencing of a large number of individuals allows us to describe the formation of de novo copy number variants, the majority of which appear to be mediated by unequal crossing over between transposable elements. This work has multiple implications for our understanding of how meiotic recombination is regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation and maintain genome stability.},

  abstract = {Background: Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) is an important tree for Japanese forestry. Male-sterile marker development in Japanese cedar would facilitate selection of male-sterile plus trees, addressing the widespread social problem of pollinosis and facilitating the identification of heterozygotes, which are useful for breeding. Results: This study used next-generation sequencing for single-nucleotide polymorphism discovery in libraries constructed from several organs, including male-sterile and male-fertile strobili. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms obtained were used to construct a high-density linkage map, which enabled identification of a locus on linkage group 9 strongly correlated with male-sterile trait. Expressed sequence tags corresponding to 11 marker loci from 5 isotigs were associated with this locus within 33.4-34.5 cM. These marker loci explained 100\% of the phenotypic variation. Several homologs of these sequences are associated with male sterility in rice or Arabidopsis, including a pre-mRNA splicing factor, a DEAD-box protein, a glycosyl hydrolase, and a galactosyltransferase. These proteins are thus candidates for the causal male-sterile gene at the ms-1 locus. After we used a SNaPshot assay to develop markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), we tested F2 progeny between male-sterile and wild-type plus trees to validate the markers and extrapolated the testing to a larger plus-tree population. We found that two developed from one of the candidates for the causal gene were suitable for MAS. Conclusions: More than half of the ESTs and SNPs we collected were new, enlarging the genomic basis for genetic research on Japanese cedar. We developed two SNP markers aimed at MAS that distinguished individuals carrying the male-sterile trait with 100\% accuracy, as well as individuals heterozygous at the male-sterile locus, even outside the mapping population. These markers should enable practical MAS for conifer breeding.},

In this chapter, we summarize the current findings on the DNA content and structure of these special regions. Core regions of rice centromeres consist of the satellite repeat CentO organized in tandem arrays and copies of the Ty3/gypsy-type retrotransposon CRR physically associated with the CentO arrays. The physical size of CentO arrays differs considerably among individual chromosomes. Unexpectedly, rice centromeres also contain active genes. Telomere satellite repeat arrays are highly conserved within the plant kingdom, but their length varies considerably among species and even among rice chromosomes. Frequent nucleotide substitutions and rearrangements of the satellite repeat sequences are detected mainly within the proximal telomere regions in rice. Subtelomere-associated repeats appear to be species-specific; at least 14 of its 24 chromosomal ends in the rice cultivar Nipponbare contain no TrsA sequences, that is, the telomere arrays are directly attached to gene-containing regions. Despite the conservation of functions, both centromeres and telomeres in rice reveal a considerable size variation and sequence divergence, thereby providing insights into the structural and evolutionary dynamics of these highly heterochromatic regions.},

Today, surveys of population genomic diversity are revealing extensive loss-of-function and gene content variation, yet the adaptive significance of much of this variation remains unknown. Here we examine the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive loss of function through the lens of population genomics and consider the challenges and opportunities of studying adaptive loss-of-function alleles using population genetics models. We discuss how the theoretically expected existence of allelic heterogeneity, defined as multiple functionally analogous mutations at the same locus, has proven consistent with empirical evidence and why this impedes both the detection of selection and causal relationships with phenotypes. We then review technical progress towards new functionally explicit population genomic tools and genotype-phenotype methods to overcome these limitations. More broadly, we discuss how the challenges of studying adaptive loss of function highlight the value of classifying genomic variation in a way consistent with the functional concept of an allele from classical population genetics.},

In this study, we present a high-quality draft of the zucchini (C. pepo) genome. The assembly has a size of 263 Mb, a scaffold N50 of 1.8 Mb and 34 240 gene models. It includes 92\% of the conserved BUSCO core gene set, and it is estimated to cover 93.0\% of the genome. The genome is organized in 20 pseudomolecules that represent 81.4\% of the assembly, and it is integrated with a genetic map of 7718 SNPs. Despite the small genome size, three independent lines of evidence support that the C. pepo genome is the result of a whole-genome duplication: the topology of the gene family phylogenies, the karyotype organization and the distribution of 4DTv distances. Additionally, 40 transcriptomes of 12 species of the genus were assembled and analysed together with all the other published genomes of the Cucurbitaceae family. The duplication was detected in all the Cucurbita species analysed, including C. maxima and C. moschata, but not in the more distant cucurbits belonging to the Cucumis and Citrullus genera, and it is likely to have occurred 30 {\AE} 4 Mya in the ancestral species that gave rise to the genus.},

  abstract = {Background: Cucurbita pepo is a cucurbit with growing economic importance worldwide. Zucchini morphotype is the most important within this highly variable species. Recently, transcriptome and Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR)- and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-based medium density maps have been reported, however further genomic tools are needed for efficient molecular breeding in the species. Our objective is to combine currently available complete transcriptomes and the Zucchini genome sequence with high throughput genotyping methods, mapping population development and extensive phenotyping to facilitate the advance of genomic research in this species. Results: We report the Genotyping-by-sequencing analysis of a RIL population developed from the inter subspecific cross Zucchini x Scallop (ssp. pepo x ssp. ovifera). Several thousands of SNP markers were identified and genotyped, followed by the construction of a high-density linkage map based on 7,718 SNPs (average of 386 markers/linkage group) covering 2,817.6 cM of the whole genome, which is a great improvement with respect to previous maps. A QTL analysis was performed using phenotypic data obtained from the RIL population from three environments. In total, 48 consistent QTLs for vine, flowering and fruit quality traits were detected on the basis of a multiple-environment analysis, distributed in 33 independent positions in 15 LGs, and each QTL explained 1.5{\textendash}62.9\% of the phenotypic variance. Eight major QTLs, which could explain greater than 20\% of the phenotypic variation were detected and the underlying candidate genes identified. Conclusions: Here we report the first SNP saturated map in the species, anchored to the physical map. Additionally, several consistent QTLs related to early flowering, fruit shape and length, and rind and flesh color are reported as well as candidate genes for them. This information will enhance molecular breeding in C. pepo and will assist the gene cloning underlying the studied QTLs, helping to reveal the genetic basis of the studied processes in squash.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are a major driver of plant genome evolution. A part from being a rich source of new genes and regulatory sequences, TEs can also affect plant genome evolution by modifying genome size and shaping chromosome structure. TEs tend to concentrate in heterochromatic pericentromeric regions and their proliferation may expand these regions. Here, we show that after the split of melon and cucumber, TEs have expanded the pericentromeric regions of melon chromosomes that, probably as a consequence, show a very low recombination frequency. In contrast, TEs have not proliferated to a high extent in cucumber, which has small TE-dense pericentromeric regions and shows a relatively constant recombination rate along chromosomes. These differences in chromosome structure also translate in differences in gene nucleotide diversity. Although gene nucleotide diversity is essentially constant along cucumber chromosomes, melon chromosomes show a bimodal pattern of genetic variability, with a gene-poor region where variability is negatively correlated with gene density. Interestingly, genes are not homogeneously distributed in melon, and the high variable low-recombining pericentromeric regions show a higher concentration of melon-specific genes whereas genes shared with cucumber and other plants are essentially found in gene-rich chromosomal arms. The results presented here suggest that melon pericentromeric regions may allow gene sequences to evolve more freely than in other chromosomal compartments which may allow new ORFs to arise and eventually be selected. These results show that TEs can drastically change the structure of chromosomes creating different chromosomal compartments imposing different constraints for gene evolution.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of genomic tools has allowed for a deeper understanding of the genetics and the evolutionary dynamics of domestication. Recent studies have suggested that multiple domestications and introgression are more common than previously thought. However, the ability to correctly infer the many aspects of domestication process depends on having an adequate representation of wild relatives. Cultivated maize (               Zea mays               ssp.               mays               ) is one of the most important crops in the world, with a long and a relatively well-documented history of domestication. The current consensus points towards a single domestication event from teosinte               Zea mays               ssp.               parviglumis               from the Balsas Basin in Southwestern Mexico. However, the underlying diversity of teosintes from               Z. mays               ssp               . parviglumis               and               Zea mays               ssp.               mexicana               was not taken into account in early studies. We used 32 739 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 29 teosinte populations and 43 maize landraces to explore the relationship between wild and cultivated members of               Zea.               We then inferred the levels of gene flow among teosinte populations and maize, the degree of population structure of               Zea mays               subspecies, and the potential domestication location of maize. We confirmed a strong geographic structure within               Z. mays               ssp.               parviglumis               and documented multiple gene flow events with other members of the genus, including an event between               Z. mays               ssp.               mexicana               and maize. Our results suggest that the likely ancestor of maize may have been domesticated in Jalisco or in the southern Pacific Coast and not in the Balsas Basin as previously thought. In this context, different populations of both teosinte subspecies have contributed to modern maize's gene pool. Our results point towards a long period of domestication marked by gene flow with wild relatives, confirming domestication as long and ongoing process.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In most organisms, the number and distribution of crossovers that occur during meiosis are tightly controlled. All chromosomes must receive at least one `obligatory crossover' and crossovers are prevented from occurring near one another by `crossover interference'. However, the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon of crossover interference has remained mostly mysterious. Using quantitative super-resolution cytogenetics and mathematical modelling, we investigate crossover positioning in the               Arabidopsis thaliana               wild-type, an over-expressor of the conserved E3 ligase HEI10, and a               hei10               heterozygous line. We show that crossover positions can be explained by a predictive, diffusion-mediated coarsening model, in which large, approximately evenly-spaced HEI10 foci grow at the expense of smaller, closely-spaced clusters. We propose this coarsening process explains many aspects of               Arabidopsis               crossover positioning, including crossover interference. Consistent with this model, we also demonstrate that crossover positioning can be predictably modified in vivo simply by altering HEI10 dosage, with higher and lower dosage leading to weaker and stronger crossover interference, respectively. As HEI10 is a conserved member of the RING finger protein family that functions in the interference-sensitive pathway for crossover formation, we anticipate that similar mechanisms may regulate crossover positioning in diverse eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Polyploidy is a major driver of evolutionary change. Autopolyploids, which arise by within-species wholegenome duplication, carry multiple nearly identical copies of each chromosome. This presents an existential challenge to sexual reproduction. Meiotic chromosome segregation requires formation of DNA crossovers (COs) between two homologous chromosomes. How can this outcome be achieved when more than two essentially equivalent partners are available? We addressed this question by comparing diploid, neo-autotetraploid, and established autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa using new approaches for analysis of meiotic CO patterns in polyploids. We discover that crossover interference, the classical process responsible for patterning of COs in diploid meiosis, is defective in the neo-autotetraploid but robust in the established autotetraploid. The presented findings suggest that, initially, diploid-like interference fails to act effectively on multivalent pairing and accompanying pre-CO recombination interactions and that stable autopolyploid meiosis can emerge by evolution of a ``supercharged'' interference process, which can now act effectively on such configurations. Thus, the basic interference mechanism responsible for simplifying CO patterns along chromosomes in diploid meiosis has evolved the capability to also simplify CO patterns among chromosomes in autopolyploids, thereby promoting bivalent formation. We further show that evolution of stable autotetraploidy preadapts meiosis to higher ploidy, which in turn has interesting mechanistic and evolutionary implications.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an essential feature of sexual reproduction that ensures faithful segregation of chromosomes and redistributes genetic variants in populations. Multiparent populations such as the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse stock accumulate large numbers of crossover (CO) events between founder haplotypes, and thus present a unique opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in shaping the recombination landscape. We obtained high-density genotype data from 6886 DO mice, and localized 2.2 million CO events to intervals with a median size of 28 kb. The resulting sex-averaged genetic map of the DO population is highly concordant with large-scale (order 10 Mb) features of previously reported genetic maps for mouse. To examine fine-scale (order 10 kb) patterns of recombination in the DO, we overlaid putative recombination hotspots onto our CO intervals. We found that CO intervals are enriched in hotspots compared to the genomic background. However, as many as 26\% of CO intervals do not overlap any putative hotspots, suggesting that our understanding of hotspots is incomplete. We also identified coldspots encompassing 329 Mb, or 12\% of observable genome, in which there is little or no recombination. In contrast to hotspots, which are a few kilobases in size, and widely scattered throughout the genome, coldspots have a median size of 2.1 Mb and are spatially clustered. Coldspots are strongly associated with copy-number variant (CNV) regions, especially multi-allelic clusters, identified from whole-genome sequencing of 228 DO mice. Genes in these regions have reduced expression, and epigenetic features of closed chromatin in male germ cells, which suggests that CNVs may repress recombination by altering chromatin structure in meiosis. Our findings demonstrate how multiparent populations, by bridging the gap between large-scale and fine-scale genetic mapping, can reveal new features of the recombination landscape.},

To facilitate gene discovery and molecular breeding in sorghum, we have characterized {$\sim$}265,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 971 worldwide accessions that have adapted to diverse agroclimatic conditions. Using this genome-wide SNP map, we have characterized population structure with respect to geographic origin and morphological type and identified patterns of ancient crop diffusion to diverse agroclimatic regions across Africa and Asia. To better understand the genomic patterns of diversification in sorghum, we quantified variation in nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination rates across the genome. Analyzing nucleotide diversity in landraces, we find evidence of selective sweeps around starch metabolism genes, whereas in landrace-derived introgression lines, we find introgressions around known height and maturity loci. To identify additional loci underlying variation in major agroclimatic traits, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on plant height components and inflorescence architecture. GWAS maps several classical loci for plant height, candidate genes for inflorescence architecture. Finally, we trace the independent spread of multiple haplotypes carrying alleles for short stature or long inflorescence branches. This genome-wide map of SNP variation in sorghum provides a basis for crop improvement through marker-assisted breeding and genomic selection.},

We report here the first genetic linkage map for Elymus. Backcross mapping populations were created by crossing caespitose Elymus wawawaiensis (EW) (Snake River wheatgrass) and rhizomatous Elymus lanceolatus (EL) (thickspike wheatgrass) to produce F1 interspecific hybrids that were then backcrossed to the same EL male to generate progeny with segregating phenotypes. EW and EL are both allotetraploid species (n = 14) containing the St (Pseudoroegneria) and H (Hordeum) genomes. A total of 387 backcross progeny from four populations were genotyped using 399 AFLP and 116 EST-based SSR and STS markers. The resulting consensus map was 2574 cM in length apportioned among the expected number of 14 linkage groups. EST-based SSR and STS markers with homology to rice genome sequences were used to identify Elymus linkage groups homoeologous to chromosomes 1{\textendash}7 of wheat. The frequency of Stderived genome markers on each linkage group was used to assign genome designations to all linkage groups, resulting in the identification of the seven St and seven H linkage groups of Elymus. This map also confirms the alloploidy and disomic chromosome pairing and segregation of Elymus and will be useful in identifying QTLs controlling perennial grass traits in this genus.

The experimental design is an F2 cross between the HS and a genetically distinct line, such as one carrying a knockout or transgene. QTL detection is performed by a standard genome scan with ŸÅ100 markers and fine mapping by typing the same animals using densely spaced markers over those candidate regions detected by the scan. The analysis uses an extension of the dynamic-programming technique employed previously to fine map QTL in HS mice.

  abstract = {Background: Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), a next-generation sequencing technology, has greatly facilitated genetic linkage mapping studies in outbred species. RAD-seq is capable of discovering thousands of genetic markers for linkage mapping across many individuals, and can be applied in species with or without a reference genome. Although several analytical tools are available for RAD-seq data, alternative strategies are necessary for improving the marker quality and hence the genetic mapping accuracy. Results: We demonstrate a strategy for constructing dense genetic linkage maps in hybrid forest trees by combining RAD-seq and whole-genome sequencing technologies. We performed RAD-seq of 150 progeny and whole-genome sequencing of the two parents in an F1 hybrid population of Populus deltoides {\texttimes} P. simonii. Two rough references were assembled from the whole-genome sequencing reads of the two parents separately. Based on the parental reference sequences, 3442 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified that segregate in the ratio of 1:1. The maternal linkage map of P. deltoides was constructed with 2012 SNPs, containing 19 linkage groups and spanning 4067.16 cM of the genome with an average distance of 2.04 cM between adjacent markers, while the male map of P. simonii consisted of 1430 SNPs and the same number of linkage groups with a total length of 4356.04 cM and an average interval distance of 3.09 cM. Collinearity between the parental linkage maps and the reference genome of P. trichocarpa was also investigated. Compared with the result on the basis of the existing reference genome, our strategy identified more high-quality SNPs and generated parental linkage groups that nicely match the karyotype of Populus. Conclusions: The strategy of simultaneously using RAD and whole-genome sequencing technologies can be applied to constructing high-density genetic maps in forest trees regardless of whether a reference genome exists. The two parental linkage maps constructed here provide more accurate genetic resources for unraveling quantitative trait loci and accelerating molecular breeding programs, as well as for comparative genomics in Populus.},

By studying five different classes of DNA sequence-dependent recombination hotspots in the fission yeast...             In meiosis, multiple different DNA sequence motifs help to position homologous recombination at hotspots in the genome. How do the seemingly disparate cis-acting regulatory modules each promote locally the activity of the basal recombination machinery? We defined molecular mechanisms of action for five different hotspot-activating DNA motifs (M26, CCAAT, Oligo-C, 4095, 4156) located independently at the same site within the ade6 locus of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Each motif promoted meiotic recombination (i.e., is active) within this context, and this activity required the respective binding proteins (transcription factors Atf1, Pcr1, Php2, Php3, Php5, Rst2). High-resolution analyses of chromatin structure by nucleosome scanning assays revealed that each motif triggers the displacement of nucleosomes surrounding the hotspot motif in meiosis. This chromatin remodeling required the respective sequence-specific binding proteins, was constitutive for two motifs, and was enhanced meiotically for three others. Hotspot activity of each motif strongly required the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme Snf22 (Snf2/Swi2), with lesser dependence on Gcn5, Mst2, and Hrp3. These findings support a model in which most meiotic recombination hotspots are positioned by the binding of transcription factors to their respective DNA sites. The functional redundancy of multiple, sequence-specific protein{\textendash}DNA complexes converges upon shared chromatin remodeling pathways that help provide the basal recombination machinery (Spo11/Rec12 complex) access to its DNA substrates within chromatin.},

  abstract = {New sources of genetic diversity must be incorporated into plant breeding programs if they are to continue increasing grain yield and quality, and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Germplasm collections provide a source of genetic and phenotypic diversity, but characterization of these resources is required to increase their utility for breeding programs. We used a barley SNP iSelect platform with 7,842 SNPs to genotype 2,417 barley accessions sampled from the USDA National Small Grains Collection of 33,176 accessions. Most of the accessions in this core collection are categorized as landraces or cultivars/breeding lines and were obtained from more than 100 countries. Both STRUCTURE and principal component analysis identified five major subpopulations within the core collection, mainly differentiated by geographical origin and spike row number (an inflorescence architecture trait). Different patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) were found across the barley genome and many regions of high LD contained traits involved in domestication and breeding selection. The genotype data were used to define `mini-core' sets of accessions capturing the majority of the allelic diversity present in the core collection. These `mini-core' sets can be used for evaluating traits that are difficult or expensive to score. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of `hull cover', `spike row number', and `heading date' demonstrate the utility of the core collection for locating genetic factors determining important phenotypes. The GWAS results were referenced to a new barley consensus map containing 5,665 SNPs. Our results demonstrate that GWAS and high-density SNP genotyping are effective tools for plant breeders interested in accessing genetic diversity in large germplasm collections.},

  abstract = {Recombination rates vary in intensity and location at the species, individual, sex and chromosome levels. Despite the fundamental biological importance of this process, the selective forces that operate to shape recombination rate and patterns are unclear. Domestication offers a unique opportunity to study the interplay between recombination and selection. In domesticates, intense selection for particular traits is imposed on small populations over many generations, resulting in organisms that differ, sometimes dramatically, in morphology and physiology from their wild ancestor. Although earlier studies suggested increased recombination rate in domesticates, a formal comparison of recombination rates between domestic mammals and their wild congeners was missing. In order to determine broad-scale recombination rate, we used immunolabeling detection of MLH1 foci as crossover markers in spermatocytes in three pairs of closely related wild and domestic species (dog and wolf, goat and ibex, and sheep and mouflon). In the three pairs, and contrary to previous suggestions, our data show that contemporary recombination rate is higher in the wild species. Subsequently, we inferred recombination breakpoints in sequence data for 16 genomic regions in dogs and wolves, each containing a locus associated with a dog phenotype potentially under selection during domestication. No difference in the number and distribution of recombination breakpoints was found between dogs and wolves. We conclude that our data indicate that strong directional selection did not result in changes in recombination in domestic mammals, and that both upper and lower bounds for crossover rates may be tightly regulated.},

  abstract = {Base composition varies among and within eukaryote genomes. Although mutational bias and selection have initially been invoked, more recently GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) has been proposed to play a central role in shaping nucleotide landscapes, especially in yeast, mammals, and birds. gBGC is a kind of meiotic drive in favor of G and C alleles, associated with recombination. Previous studies have also suggested that gBGC could be at work in grass genomes. However, these studies were carried on third codon positions that can undergo selection on codon usage. As most preferred codons end in G or C in grasses, gBGC and selection can be confounded. Here we investigated further the forces that might drive GC content evolution in the rice genus using both coding and noncoding sequences. We found that recombination rates correlate positively with equilibrium GC content and that selfing species (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima) have significantly lower equilibrium GC content compared with more outcrossing species. As recombination is less efficient in selfing species, these results suggest that recombination drives GC content. We also detected a positive relationship between expression levels and GC content in third codon positions, suggesting that selection favors codons ending with G or C bases. However, the correlation between GC content and recombination cannot be explained by selection on codon usage alone as it was also observed in noncoding positions. Finally, analyses of polymorphism data ruled out the hypothesis that genomic variation in GC content is due to mutational processes. Our results suggest that both gBGC and selection on codon usage affect GC content in the Oryza genus and likely in other grass species.},

This map, which has a resolution several orders of magnitude greater than previous studies, identifies over 25 000 recombination hotspots and gives new insights into the distribution and determination of recombination. Wavelet-based analysis demonstrates scale-specific influences of base composition, coding context and DNA repeats on recombination rates, though, in contrast with other species, no association with DNase I hypersensitivity. We have also identified specific DNA motifs that are strongly associated with recombination hotspots and whose activity is influenced by local context. Comparative analysis of recombination rates in humans and chimpanzees demonstrates very high rates of evolution of the fine-scale structure of the recombination landscape. In the light of these observations, we suggest possible resolutions of the hotspot paradox.},

  abstract = {Homing in on Hotspots                            The clustering of recombination in the genome, around locations known as hotspots, is associated with specific DNA motifs. Now, using a variety of techniques, three studies implicate a chromatin-modifying protein, the histone-methyltransferase PRDM9, as a major factor involved in human hotspots (see the Perspective by                                Cheung                 et al.                              ).                                Parvanov                 et al.                              (p.               835               , published online 31 December) mapped the locus in mice, and analyzed allelic variation in mice and humans, whereas                                Myers                 et al.                              (p.               876               , published online 31 December) used a comparative analysis between human and chimpanzees to show that the recombination process leads to a self-destructive drive in which the very motifs that recruit hotspots are eliminated from our genome.                                Baudat                 et al.                              (p.               836               , published online 31 December) took this analysis a step further to identify human allelic variants within Prdm9 that differed in the frequency at which they used hotspots. Furthermore, differential binding of this protein to different human alleles suggests that this protein interacts with specific DNA sequences. Thus, PDRM9 functions in the determination of recombination loci within the genome and may be a significant factor in the genomic differences between closely related species.                        ,              Bioinformatics identifies a chromatin-modifying enzyme as a factor in determining recombination hotspots.           ,              Although present in both humans and chimpanzees, recombination hotspots, at which meiotic crossover events cluster, differ markedly in their genomic location between the species. We report that a 13{\textendash}base pair sequence motif previously associated with the activity of 40\% of human hotspots does not function in chimpanzees and is being removed by self-destructive drive in the human lineage. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the rapidly evolving zinc-finger protein PRDM9 binds to this motif and that sequence changes in the protein may be responsible for hotspot differences between species. The involvement of PRDM9, which causes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, implies that there is a common mechanism for recombination hotspots in eukaryotes but raises questions about what forces have driven such rapid change.},

  abstract = {Abstract             If loci are randomly distributed on a physical map, the density of markers on a genetic map will be inversely proportional to recombination rate. First proposed by MARY LYON, we have used this idea to estimate recombination rates from the Drosophila melanogaster linkage map. These results were compared with results of two other studies that estimated regional recombination rates in D. melanogaster using both physical and genetic maps. The three methods were largely concordant in identifying large-scale genomic patterns of recombination. The marker density method was then applied to the Mus musculus microsatellite linkage map. The distribution of microsatellites provided evidence for heterogeneity in recombination rates. Centromeric regions for several mouse chromosomes had significantly greater numbers of markers than expected, suggesting that recombination rates were lower in these regions. In contrast, most telomeric regions contained significantly fewer markers than expected. This indicates that recombination rates are elevated at the telomeres of many mouse chromosomes and is consistent with a comparison of the genetic and cytogenetic maps in these regions. The density of markers on a genetic map may provide a generally useful way to estimate regional recombination rates in species for which genetic, but not physical, maps are available.},

  abstract = {Recently diverged taxa may continue to exchange genes. A number of models of speciation with gene flow propose that the frequency of gene exchange will be lower in genomic regions of low recombination and that these regions will therefore be more differentiated. However, several population-genetic models that focus on selection at linked sites also predict greater differentiation in regions of low recombination simply as a result of faster sorting of ancestral alleles even in the absence of gene flow. Moreover, identifying the actual amount of gene flow from patterns of genetic variation is tricky, because both ancestral polymorphism and migration lead to shared variation between recently diverged taxa. New analytic methods have been developed to help distinguish ancestral polymorphism from migration. Along with a growing number of datasets of multi-locus DNA sequence variation, these methods have spawned a renewed interest in speciation models with gene flow. Here, we review both speciation and population-genetic models that make explicit predictions about how the rate of recombination influences patterns of genetic variation within and between species. We then compare those predictions with empirical data of DNA sequence variation in rabbits and mice. We find strong support for the prediction that genomic regions experiencing low levels of recombination are more differentiated. In most cases, reduced gene flow appears to contribute to the pattern, although disentangling the relative contribution of reduced gene flow and selection at linked sites remains a challenge. We suggest fruitful areas of research that might help distinguish between different models.},

  abstract = {Background: The strawberry, Fragaria {\texttimes} ananassa, is an allo-octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) and outcrossing species. Although it is the most widely consumed berry crop in the world, its complex genome structure has hindered its genetic and genomic analysis, and thus discrimination of subgenome-specific loci among the homoeologous chromosomes is needed. In the present study, we identified candidate subgenome-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, and constructed a linkage map using an S1 mapping population of the cultivar `Reikou' with an IStraw90 Axiom{\textregistered} SNP array and previously published SSR markers. Results: The `Reikou' linkage map consisted of 11,574 loci (11,002 SNPs and 572 SSR loci) spanning 2816.5 cM of 31 linkage groups. The 11,574 loci were located on 4738 unique positions (bin) on the linkage map. Of the mapped loci, 8999 (8588 SNPs and 411 SSR loci) showed a 1:2:1 segregation ratio of AA:AB:BB allele, which suggested the possibility of deriving loci from candidate subgenome-specific sequences. In addition, 2575 loci (2414 SNPs and 161 SSR loci) showed a 3:1 segregation of AB:BB allele, indicating they were derived from homoeologous genomic sequences. Comparative analysis of the homoeologous linkage groups revealed differences in genome structure among the subgenomes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that candidate subgenome-specific loci are randomly located across the genomes, and that there are small- to large-scale structural variations among the subgenomes. The mapped SNPs and SSR loci on the linkage map are expected to be seed points for the construction of pseudomolecules in the octoploid strawberry.},

  abstract = {Background: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an allotetraploid species whose ancestral genomes are most likely derived from the A-genome species, A. duranensis, and the B-genome species, A. ipaensis. The very recent (several millennia) evolutionary origin of A. hypogaea has imposed a bottleneck for allelic and phenotypic diversity within the cultigen. However, wild diploid relatives are a rich source of alleles that could be used for crop improvement and their simpler genomes can be more easily analyzed while providing insight into the structure of the allotetraploid peanut genome. The objective of this research was to establish a high-density genetic map of the diploid species A. duranensis based on de novo generated EST databases. Arachis duranensis was chosen for mapping because it is the A-genome progenitor of cultivated peanut and also in order to circumvent the confounding effects of gene duplication associated with allopolyploidy in A. hypogaea. Results: More than one million expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences generated from normalized cDNA libraries of A. duranensis were assembled into 81,116 unique transcripts. Mining this dataset, 1236 EST-SNP markers were developed between two A. duranensis accessions, PI 475887 and Grif 15036. An additional 300 SNP markers also were developed from genomic sequences representing conserved legume orthologs. Of the 1536 SNP markers, 1054 were placed on a genetic map. In addition, 598 EST-SSR markers identified in A. hypogaea assemblies were included in the map along with 37 disease resistance gene candidate (RGC) and 35 other previously published markers. In total, 1724 markers spanning 1081.3 cM over 10 linkage groups were mapped. Gene sequences that provided mapped markers were annotated using similarity searches in three different databases, and gene ontology descriptions were determined using the Medicago Gene Atlas and TAIR databases. Synteny analysis between A. duranensis, Medicago and Glycine revealed significant stretches of conserved gene clusters spread across the peanut genome. A higher level of colinearity was detected between A. duranensis and Glycine than with Medicago. Conclusions: The first high-density, gene-based linkage map for A. duranensis was generated that can serve as a reference map for both wild and cultivated Arachis species. The markers developed here are valuable resources for the peanut, and more broadly, to the legume research community. The A-genome map will have utility for fine mapping in other peanut species and has already had application for mapping a nematode resistance gene that was introgressed into A. hypogaea from A. cardenasii.},

  abstract = {Evolution at a multiallelic locus under the joint action of gene conversion, mutation, selection, and random genetic drift is studied. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the diploid, monoecious population mates at random. Under the assumption that all four evolutionary forces are weak, a diffusion approximation is established for the dynamics of the gene frequencies. For two alleles, the inclusion of gene conversion merely alters one of the two selection parameters of the thoroughly investigated diffusion process without conversion. Therefore, all results for this classical process, some of which are reviewed and extended here, are immediately applicable to the biologically more general problem. Small conversional disparities can dramatically affect the fixation probability (and hence the rate of gene substitution) and can greatly reduce the mean conditional fixation time of a new mutant. The mean absorption and fixation times are often sufficiently short to imply that biased gene conversion can be an important mechanism for the loss of genetic variability in and the genetic divergence of isolated populations.},

  abstract = {Background: Japanese gentians (Gentiana triflora and Gentiana scabra) are amongst the most popular floricultural plants in Japan. However, genomic resources for Japanese gentians have not yet been developed, mainly because of the heterozygous genome structure conserved by outcrossing, the long juvenile period, and limited knowledge about the inheritance of important traits. In this study, we developed a genetic linkage map to improve breeding programs of Japanese gentians. Results: Enriched simple sequence repeat (SSR) libraries from a G. triflora double haploid line yielded almost 20,000 clones using 454 pyrosequencing technology, 6.7\% of which could be used to design SSR markers. To increase the number of molecular markers, we identified three putative long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences using the recently developed inter-primer binding site (iPBS) method. We also developed retrotransposon microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) markers combining retrotransposon and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. In addition to SSR and REMAP markers, modified amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were developed. Using 93 BC1 progeny from G. scabra backcrossed with a G. triflora double haploid line, 19 linkage groups were constructed with a total of 263 markers (97 SSR, 97 AFLP, 39 RAPD, and 30 REMAP markers). One phenotypic trait (stem color) and 10 functional markers related to genes controlling flower color, flowering time and cold tolerance were assigned to the linkage map, confirming its utility. Conclusions: This is the first reported genetic linkage map for Japanese gentians and for any species belonging to the family Gentianaceae. As demonstrated by mapping of functional markers and the stem color trait, our results will help to explain the genetic basis of agronomic important traits, and will be useful for marker-assisted selection in gentian breeding programs. Our map will also be an important resource for further genetic analyses such as mapping of quantitative trait loci and map-based cloning of genes in this species.},

In most species, sister chromatid cohesion and reciprocal recombination (crossing-over) between homologous chromosomes are essential to provide tension to signal proper chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division. Crossovers are not distributed uniformly throughout the genome and are repressed at and near the centromeres. Rare crossovers that occur too near or in the centromere interfere with proper segregation and can give rise to aneuploid progeny, which can be severely defective or inviable. We review here how crossing-over occurs and how it is prevented in and around the centromeres. Molecular mechanisms of centromeric repression are only now being elucidated. However, rapid advances in understanding crossing-over, chromosome structure, and centromere functions promise to explain how potentially deleterious crossovers are avoided in certain chromosomal regions while allowing beneficial crossovers in others.},

  abstract = {Selective and/or neutral processes may govern variation in DNA content and, ultimately, genome size. The observation in several organisms of a negative correlation between recombination rate and intron size could be compatible with a neutral model in which recombination is mutagenic for length changes. We used whole-genome data on small insertions and deletions within transposable elements from chicken and zebra finch to demonstrate clear links between recombination rate and a number of attributes of reduced DNA content. Recombination rate was negatively correlated with the length of introns, transposable elements, and intergenic spacer and with the rate of short insertions. Importantly, it was positively correlated with gene density, the rate of short deletions, the deletion bias, and the net change in sequence length. All these observations point at a pattern of more condensed genome structure in regions of high recombination. Based on the observed rates of small insertions and deletions and assuming that these rates are representative for the whole genome, we estimate that the genome of the most recent common ancestor of birds and lizards has lost nearly 20\% of its DNA content up until the present. Expansion of transposable elements can counteract the effect of deletions in an equilibrium mutation model; however, since the activity of transposable elements has been low in the avian lineage, the deletion bias is likely to have had a significant effect on genome size evolution in dinosaurs and birds, contributing to the maintenance of a small genome. We also demonstrate that most of the observed correlations between recombination rate and genome contraction parameters are seen in the human genome, including for segregating indel polymorphisms. Our data are compatible with a neutral model in which recombination drives vertebrate genome size evolution and gives no direct support for a role of natural selection in this process.},

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Previous studies conducted on limited number of accessions have reported very low genetic variation in African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) as compared to its wild progenitor (O. barthii A. Chev.) and to Asian rice (O. sativa L.). Here, we characterized a large collection of African rice and compared its molecular diversity indices and population structure with the two other species using genomewide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNPs that mapped within selective sweeps. A total of 3245 samples representing African rice (2358), Asian rice (772) and O. barthii (115) were genotyped with 26,073 physically mapped SNPs. Using all SNPs, the level of marker polymorphism, average genetic distance and nucleotide diversity in African rice accounted for 59.1\%, 63.2\% and 37.1\% of that of O. barthii, respectively. SNP polymorphism and overall nucleotide diversity of the African rice accounted for 20.1{\textendash}32.1 and 16.3{\textendash}37.3\% of that of the Asian rice, respectively. We identified 780 SNPs that fell within 37 candidate selective sweeps in African rice, which were distributed across all 12 rice chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity of the African rice estimated from the 780 SNPs was 8.3\,{\texttimes}\,10-4, which is not only 20-fold smaller than the value estimated from all genomewide SNPs ({$\pi$}\,=\,1.6\,{\texttimes}\,10-2), but also accounted for just 4.1\%, 0.9\% and 2.1\% of that of O. barthii, lowland Asian rice and upland Asian rice, respectively. The genotype data generated for a large collection of rice accessions conserved at the AfricaRice genebank will be highly useful for the global rice community and promote germplasm use.},

Most population genetics inferences are based on frameworks assuming that adaptive evolution is rare. But if positive selection operates on many loci simultaneously, as has recently been suggested for many species, including animals such as flies, then a different approach is necessary. In this review, I discuss recent progress in characterizing and understanding evolution in rapidly adapting populations, in which random associations of mutations with genetic backgrounds of different fitness, i.e., genetic draft, dominate over genetic drift. As a result, neutral genetic diversity depends weakly on population size but strongly on the rate of adaptation or more generally the variance in fitness. Coalescent processes with multiple mergers, rather than Kingman's coalescent, are appropriate genealogical models for rapidly adapting populations, with important implications for population genetics inference.},

  abstract = {Background: The centromeric and pericentromeric regions of plant chromosomes are colonized by Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, which, on the basis of their reverse transcriptase sequences, form the chromovirus CRM clade. Despite their potential importance for centromere evolution and function, they have remained poorly characterized. In this work, we aimed to carry out a comprehensive survey of CRM clade elements with an emphasis on their diversity, structure, chromosomal distribution and transcriptional activity. Results: We have surveyed a set of 190 CRM elements belonging to 81 different retrotransposon families, derived from 33 host species and falling into 12 plant families. The sequences at the C-terminus of their integrases were unexpectedly heterogeneous, despite the understanding that they are responsible for targeting to the centromere. This variation allowed the division of the CRM clade into the three groups A, B and C, and the members of each differed considerably with respect to their chromosomal distribution. The differences in chromosomal distribution coincided with variation in the integrase C-terminus sequences possessing a putative targeting domain (PTD). A majority of the group A elements possess the CR motif and are concentrated in the centromeric region, while members of group C have the type II chromodomain and are dispersed throughout the genome. Although representatives of the group B lack a PTD of any type, they appeared to be localized preferentially in the centromeres of tested species. All tested elements were found to be transcriptionally active. Conclusions: Comprehensive analysis of the CRM clade elements showed that genuinely centromeric retrotransposons represent only a fraction of the CRM clade (group A). These centromeric retrotransposons represent an active component of centromeres of a wide range of angiosperm species, implying that they play an important role in plant centromere evolution. In addition, their transcriptional activity is consistent with the notion that the transcription of centromeric retrotransposons has a role in normal centromere function.},

Yet the lack of population-level recombination rate data leaves this hypothesis untested in natural populations. Here we examine the population-level recombination rate variation in two incipient ecological species, the microcrustacean             Daphnia pulex             (an ephemeral-pond species) and             D. pulicaria             (a permanent-lake species). The divergence of             D. pulicaria             from             D. pulex             involved habitat shifts from pond to lake habitats as well as strong local adaptation due to directional selection. Using a novel single-sperm genotyping approach, we estimated the male-specific recombination rate of two linkage groups in multiple populations of each species in common garden experiments and identified a significantly elevated recombination rate in             D. pulicaria             . Most importantly, population genetic analyses show that the divergence in recombination rate between these two species is most likely due to divergent selection in distinct ecological habitats rather than neutral evolution.                                   Significance statement                            Whether directional selection during adaptation to a novel habitat results in elevated meiotic recombination remains largely untested in natural populations. This work examines the population-level recombination rate in two closely related microcructacean species               Daphnia pulex               and               D. pulicaria               using single-sperm genotyping approach. Recombination rate data from two linkage groups show elevated recombination rates in               D. pulicaria               whose divergence from               D. pulex               is accompanied by a habitat shift.

Based on the high-density bin map, we updated Zhanggu reference with 416 Mb after adding 16 Mb unanchored scaffolds and Yugu reference with some assembly error correction and 3158 gaps filled. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of nine agronomic traits was done based on this RIL population, five of which were controlled by a single gene. Meanwhile, two QTLs were found for plant height, and a candidate gene showed 89\% identity to the known rice gibberellin-synthesis gene sd1. Three QTLs were found for the trait of heading date. The whole genome resequencing and QTL mapping provided important tools for foxtail millet research and breeding.

First, TAD establishment in               X. tropicalis               is similar to that in mice and flies and does not depend on zygotic genome transcriptional activation. This process is followed by further refinements in active and repressive chromatin compartments and the appearance of loops and stripes. Second, within TADs, higher self-interaction frequencies at one end of the boundary are associated with higher DNA occupancy of the architectural proteins CTCF and Rad21. Third, the chromatin remodeling factor ISWI is required for de novo TAD formation. Finally, TAD structures are variable in different tissues. Our work shows that               X. tropicalis               is a powerful model for chromosome architecture analysis and suggests that chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in de novo TAD establishment.},

Its distribution is wider than those of its congeneric species, despite an extreme genetic bottleneck event that severely diminished its genetic variation. Here, we demonstrate that transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genetic variation that could account for its high phenotypic diversity. TEs are (               i               ) highly enriched in               C. rubella               compared with its outcrossing sister species               Capsella grandiflora               , and (               ii               ) 4.2\% of polymorphic TEs in               C. rubella               are associated with variation in the expression levels of their adjacent genes. Furthermore, we show that frequent TE insertions at               FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)               in natural populations of               C. rubella               could explain 12.5\% of the natural variation in flowering time, a key life history trait correlated with fitness and adaptation. In particular, we show that a recent TE insertion at the 3{${'}$} UTR of               FLC               affects mRNA stability, which results in reducing its steady-state expression levels, to promote the onset of flowering. Our results highlight that TE insertions can drive rapid phenotypic variation, which could potentially help with adaptation to changing environments in a species with limited standing genetic variation.},

The increasing availability of high-density genetic markers allows the estimation of historical changes in               N                                e                              across time using measures of genome diversity or linkage disequilibrium between markers.

Here we investigate by computer simulations the consequences of selection (both positive and negative) and recombination rate heterogeneity in the estimation of historical               N                                e                              .

In contrast, those estimates obtained by coalescence mutation-recombination-based methods can be strongly affected by it, which could have important consequences for the estimation of human demography. The simulation results are supported by the analysis of human data. The estimates of               N                                e                 LD                              obtained for particular genomic regions do not correlate, or they do it very weakly, with recombination rate, nucleotide diversity, proportion of polymorphic sites, background selection statistic, minor allele frequency of SNPs, loss of function and missense variants and gene density.

The mathematical principles of the theory of these processes are briefly described. Birth-and-death processes, with some straightforward additions such as innovation, are a simple, natural and formal framework for modeling a vast variety of biological processes such as population dynamics, speciation, genome evolution, including growth of paralogous gene families and horizontal gene transfer and somatic evolution of cancers. We further describe how empirical data, e.g. distributions of paralogous gene family size, can be used to choose the model that best reflects the actual course of evolution among different versions of birth-deathand-innovation models. We conclude that birth-and-death processes, thanks to their mathematical transparency, flexibility and relevance to fundamental biological processes, are going to be an indispensable mathematical tool for the burgeoning field of systems biology.},

  abstract = {In order to implement highly efficient brain-machine interface (BMI) systems, high-channel count sensing is often used to record extracellular action potentials. However, the extracellular recordings are typically severely contaminated by artefacts and various noise sources, rendering the separation of multi-unit neural recordings an immensely challenging task. Removing artefact and noise from neural events can improve the spike sorting performance and classification accuracy. This paper presents a deep learning technique called deep spike detection (DSD) with a strong learning ability of high-dimensional vectors for neural channel selection and artefacts removal from the selected neural channel. The proposed method significantly improves spike detection compared to the conventional methods by sequentially diminishing the noise level and discarding the active artefacts in the recording channels. The simulated and experimental results show that there is considerably better performance when the extracellular raw recordings are cleaned prior to assigning individual spikes to the neurons that generated them. The DSD achieves an overall classification accuracy of 91.53\% and outperformes Wave\_clus by 3.38\% on the simulated dataset with various noise levels and artefacts.},

  abstract = {Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass), a diploid wheat relative, is known to be a rich source of disease resistance genes for wheat improvement. To facilitate the transfer of these genes into wheat, information on their chromosomal location is important. A genetic linkage map of Ae. sharonensis was constructed based on 179 F               2               plants derived from a cross between accessions resistant (1644) and susceptible (1193) to wheat leaf rust. The linkage map was based on 389 markers (377 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci) and was comprised of 10 linkage groups, ranging from 2.3 to 124.6 cM. The total genetic length of the map was 818.0 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 3.63 cM. Based on the chromosomal location of 115 markers previously mapped in wheat, the four linkage groups of A, B, C, and E were assigned to Ae. sharonensis (S               sh               ) and homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6, 1, 3, and 2. The single dominant gene (designated LrAeSh1644) conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ in accession 1644 was positioned on linkage group A (chromosome 6S               sh               ) and was flanked by DArT markers wpt-9881 (at 1.9 cM distal from the gene) and wpt-6925 (4.5 cM proximal). This study clearly demonstrates the utility of DArT for genotyping uncharacterized species and tagging resistance genes where pertinent genomic information is lacking.},

  abstract = {Background: Most modern citrus cultivars have an interspecific origin. As a foundational step towards deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence was produced by the International Citrus Genome Consortium from a haploid derived from Clementine mandarin. The availability of a saturated genetic map of Clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. Clementine is believed to be a `Mediterranean' mandarin {\texttimes} sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine. Results: Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. Skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female Clementine mapping data. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between `Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange. The results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome. Conclusions: A reference genetic map of citrus, used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the first citrus reference genome sequence, was established. The high conservation of marker order observed at the interspecific level should allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences by mapping next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the reference genome sequence. The genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence appears to have been inherited primarily from the `Mediterranean' mandarin. The high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the male Clementine data underline the probable extent of deviation from Mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in male parents.},

As a foundational step towards deciphering the interspecific genome structures, a reference whole genome sequence was produced by the International Citrus Genome Consortium from a haploid derived from Clementine mandarin. The availability of a saturated genetic map of Clementine was identified as an essential prerequisite to assist the whole genome sequence assembly. Clementine is believed to be a `Mediterranean' mandarin {\texttimes} sweet orange hybrid, and sweet orange likely arose from interspecific hybridizations between mandarin and pummelo gene pools. The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map using codominant markers, and to perform comparative mapping of pummelo, sweet orange, and Clementine. Results: Five parental genetic maps were established from three segregating populations, which were genotyped with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and Insertion-Deletion (Indel) markers. An initial medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of the Clementine was established by combining male and female Clementine segregation data. This Clementine map was compared with two pummelo maps and a sweet orange map. The linear order of markers was highly conserved in the different species. However, significant differences in map size were observed, which suggests a variation in the recombination rates. Skewed segregations were much higher in the male than female Clementine mapping data. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between `Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange. The results identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome. Conclusions: A reference genetic map of citrus, used to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the first citrus reference genome sequence, was established. The high conservation of marker order observed at the interspecific level should allow reasonable inferences of most citrus genome sequences by mapping next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the reference genome sequence. The genome of the haploid Clementine used to establish the citrus reference genome sequence appears to have been inherited primarily from the `Mediterranean' mandarin. The high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the male Clementine data underline the probable extent of deviation from Mendelian segregation for characters controlled by heterozygous loci in male parents.},

  abstract = {Gene and genome duplications have given rise to enormous variability among species in the number of genes within their genomes. Gene copies have in turn played important roles in adaptation, having been implicated in the evolution of the immune response, insecticide resistance, efficient protein synthesis, and vertebrate body plans. In this chapter, we discuss the life history of gene duplications, from their first appearance within a population, through the period during which they rise in frequency or disappear, to their long-term fate. At each phase, we discuss the evolutionary processes that have influenced the dynamics of gene duplications and shaped their ultimate roles within a population. We argue that there is no evidence that organisms have evolved strategies to promote gene duplication in order to permit adaptive evolution. In contrast, many mechanisms exist to silence or eliminate duplicated genes, suggesting that selection has acted largely to reduce the rate of gene duplication. We also argue that natural selection has functioned as an effective sieve, increasing the representation of beneficial gene duplicates among those that establish within a population and that play a long-term role in evolution. To refine our understanding of how selection acts on new gene duplications, we provide a model incorporating a single-copy gene, its gene duplicate, and selection either favoring heterozygotes or eliminating deleterious mutations. Although both forms of selection can increase the initial rate of spread of a gene duplicate, the efficacy with which they do so differs dramatically. Heterozygote advantage always increases the rate of spread and can have a large impact. In contrast, masking deleterious mutations never has a large effect on the rate of spread of the duplicate, and this minor effect can be negative as well as positive. In both cases, the degree of linkage between the two gene copies affects the rate of spread of the duplication. Finally, we discuss evolutionary processes that occur over longer periods after a gene duplication has become established within a population. These long-term processes include maintenance, inactivation, and diversification in function. Consideration of each of the short-term and long-term processes affecting duplicated genes illustrates the subtle ways in which selection has acted to shape genomic structure.

Yet crossover numbers are evolutionarily constrained, with at least one and not many more than one crossover per bivalent in most taxa. Crossover interference, whereby a crossover reduces the probability of a neighboring crossover, contributes to this homogeneity. The mechanisms by which interference is achieved and crossovers are regulated are a major current subject of inquiry, facilitated by novel methods to visualize crossovers and to pinpoint recombination events. Here, we review patterns of crossover interference and the models built to describe this process. We then discuss the selective forces that have likely shaped interference and the regulation of crossover numbers.},

The strength of selection favoring a modifier that increases recombination is proportional to A'S\&/ r when linkage is tight and h2S3Sr/N when linkage is loose, where A is the beneficial mutation rate per genome per generation throughouta population of size N, S is the average mutant effect, r is the average recombination rate, and\&is the amount thartecombination is modified.

  abstract = {Background: Due to the recent domestication of peanut from a single tetraploidization event, relatively little genetic diversity underlies the extensive morphological and agronomic diversity in peanut cultivars today. To broaden the genetic variation in future breeding programs, it is necessary to characterize germplasm accessions for new sources of variation and to leverage the power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discover markers associated with traits of interest. We report an analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD), population structure, and genetic diversity, and examine the ability of GWA to infer marker-trait associations in the U.S. peanut mini core collection genotyped with a 58 K SNP array. Results: LD persists over long distances in the collection, decaying to r2 = half decay distance at 3.78 Mb. Structure within the collection is best explained when separated into four or five groups (K = 4 and K = 5). At K = 4 and 5, accessions loosely clustered according to market type and subspecies, though with numerous exceptions. Out of 107 accessions, 43 clustered in correspondence to the main market type subgroup whereas 34 did not. The remaining 30 accessions had either missing taxonomic classification or were classified as mixed. Phylogenetic network analysis also clustered accessions into approximately five groups based on their genotypes, with loose correspondence to subspecies and market type. Genome wide association analysis was performed on these lines for 12 seed composition and quality traits. Significant marker associations were identified for arachidic and behenic fatty acid compositions, which despite having low bioavailability in peanut, have been reported to raise cholesterol levels in humans. Other traits such as blanchability showed consistent associations in multiple tests, with plausible candidate genes. Conclusions: Based on GWA, population structure as well as additional simulation results, we find that the primary limitations of this collection for GWAS are a small collection size, significant remaining structure/genetic similarity and long LD blocks that limit the resolution of association mapping. These results can be used to improve GWAS in peanut in future studies {\textendash} for example, by increasing the size and reducing structure in the collections used for GWAS.},

We found that high-recombination regions (1-kb windows among those in the highest 5\% of the distribution) on all three chromosomes were significantly closer to the centromere, had higher gene density, and lower GC content than low-recombination windows. High-recombination windows are also significantly overrepresented among some gene functional categories{\textemdash}most strongly NB{\textendash}ARC and LRR genes, both of which are important in plant defense against pathogens. Similar to high-recombination windows, recombination hotspots (1-kb windows with significantly higher recombination than the surrounding region) are significantly nearer to the centromere than nonhotspot windows. By contrast, we detected no difference in gene density or GC content between hotspot and nonhotspot windows. Using linear model wavelet analysis to examine the relationship between recombination and genomic features across multiple spatial scales, we find a significant negative correlation with distance to the centromere across scales up to 512 kb, whereas gene density and GC content show significantly positive and negative correlations, respectively, only up to 64 kb. Correlations between recombination and genomic features, particularly gene density and polymorphism, suggest that they are scale dependent and need to be assessed at scales relevant to the evolution of those features.},

  abstract = {Understanding the composition, evolution, and function of the Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) genome is complicated by the joint presence of two genomes in its nucleus (AT and DT genomes). These two genomes were derived from progenitor A-genome and D-genome diploids involved in ancestral allopolyploidization. To better understand the allopolyploid genome, we re-sequenced the genomes of extant diploid relatives that contain the A1 (Gossypium herbaceum), A2 (Gossypium arboreum), or D5 (Gossypium raimondii) genomes. We conducted a comparative analysis using deep re-sequencing of multiple accessions of each diploid species and identified 24 million SNPs between the A-diploid and D-diploid genomes. These analyses facilitated the construction of a robust index of conserved SNPs between the A-genomes and D-genomes at all detected polymorphic loci. This index is widely applicable for read mapping efforts of other diploid and allopolyploid Gossypium accessions. Further analysis also revealed locations of putative duplications and deletions in the A-genome relative to the D-genome reference sequence. The approximately 25,400 deleted regions included more than 50\% deletion of 978 genes, including many involved with starch synthesis. In the polyploid genome, we also detected 1,472 conversion events between homoeologous chromosomes, including events that overlapped 113 genes. Continued characterization of the Gossypium genomes will further enhance our ability to manipulate fiber and agronomic production of cotton.},

  abstract = {Background: The taxonomic name of an organism is a key link between different databases that store information on that organism. However, in the absence of a single, comprehensive database of organism names, individual databases lack an easy means of checking the correctness of a name. Furthermore, the same organism may have more than one name, and the same name may apply to more than one organism. Results: The Taxonomic Search Engine (TSE) is a web application written in PHP that queries multiple taxonomic databases (ITIS, Index Fungorum, IPNI, NCBI, and uBIO) and summarises the results in a consistent format. It supports "drill-down" queries to retrieve a specific record. The TSE can optionally suggest alternative spellings the user can try. It also acts as a Life Science Identifier (LSID) authority for the source taxonomic databases, providing globally unique identifiers (and associated metadata) for each name. Conclusion: The Taxonomic Search Engine is available at http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/{\textasciitilde}rpage/ portal/ and provides a simple demonstration of the potential of the federated approach to providing access to taxonomic names.},

  abstract = {Genetic linkage maps have been produced for a wide range of organisms during the last decade, thanks to the increasing availability of molecular markers. The use of microsatellites (or Simple Sequence Repeats, SSRs) as genetic markers has led to the construction of ``second-generation'' genetic maps for humans, mouse and other organisms of major importance. We constructed a second-generation single-tree genetic linkage map of Norway spruce (Picea abies K.) using a panel of 72 haploid megagametophytes with a total of 447 segregating bands [366 Ampli{\textregistered}ed Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), 20 Selective Ampli{\textregistered}cation of Microsatellite Polymorphic Loci (SAMPLs) and 61 SSRs, each single band being treated initially as a dominant marker]. Four hundred and thirteen markers were mapped in 29 linkage groups (including triplets and doublets) covering a genetic length of 2198.3 cM, which represents 77.4\% of the estimated genome length of Picea abies (approximately 2839 cM). The map is still far from coalescing into the expected 12 chromosomal linkage groups of Norway spruce (2n ¬à 2x ¬à 24). A possible explanation for this comes from the observed non-random distribution of markers in the framework map. Thirty-eight SSR marker loci could be mapped onto 19 linkage groups. This set of highly informative Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs) can be used in many aspects of genetic analysis of forest trees, such as markerassisted selection, QTL mapping, positional cloning, gene {\textasciimacron}ow analysis, mating system analysis and genetic diversity studies.},

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) are most abundant form of molecular genetic marker which represents a single nucleotide difference between two individuals at a defined location. Compare to others SNPs are direct sequence variation which offers the precise nature of the allelic variants among different genotypes. Further, it signify recurrent type of genetic polymorphism with high density genome coverage. Advent of Next generation sequencing technology drives the exploration of sequence diversity for various crops. These studies revealed abundance of SNPs in plant systems, with the frequency of 100-300bp per SNP.SNP detection based on EST(expressed sequence tags) sequence data has been performed for crops like maize, barley, tomato and trees like pine and in Arabidopsis which is a model plant. Similarly SNP identification based on array analyses has been published for Arabidopsis, rice, barley and maize. Amplicon resequencing approach has been utilized for the identification of SNPs in maize, soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, sugarbeet, barley and spruce. There are two sets of data to perform SNP mining one is reference sequence data and other is de novo sequence data. This mining for various datasets mainly comprise of subsequent steps: in first step we have to group sequence reads on the basis of their sequence resemblance and confirm identity of reads whether they are covering similar part of genome or they have the same transcript origin. Further we have to align confirm reads and finally identify and categorize sequence variants as probable polymorphic loci/marker. Thus SNP mining can provide better understanding of crops at the gene level, for the detailed analysis of germplasm and eventually for the resourceful management of genetic diversity on a whole genome level inside plant breeding.},

  abstract = {The nonrandom distribution of meiotic recombination influences patterns of inheritance and genome evolution, but chromosomal features governing this distribution are poorly understood. Formation of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination results in the accumulation of Spo11 protein covalently bound to small DNA fragments. By sequencing these fragments, we uncover a genome-wide DSB map of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. We use this map to explore how DSB distribution is influenced by large-scale chromosome structures, chromatin, transcription factors, and local sequence composition. Our analysis offers mechanistic insight into DSB formation and early processing steps, supporting the view that the recombination terrain is molded by combinatorial and hierarchical interaction of factors that work on widely different size scales. This map illuminates the occurrence of DSBs in repetitive DNA elements, repair of which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements. We also discuss implications for evolutionary dynamics of recombination hot spots.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Insertion or deletion polymorphism (InDel) is one of the main genetic variations in plant genomes. However, there are few studies on InDels across the whole genome in               Populus               . In this study, we investigated genome-wide InDels in               Populus deltoides               and               Populus simonii               and InDel segregation in their F               1               hybrid population with restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) data. A total of 119,066 InDels were identified in               P. deltoides               and               P. simonii               according to the reference genome of               Populus trichocarpa               , including 58,532 unique InDels in               P. deltoides               , 54,469 unique InDels in               P. simonii               , and 6,065 common InDels in both. Meanwhile, the distribution of these InDels was analyzed along chromosomes, indicating that the distribution patterns for both species were largely similar, but the average InDel density was slightly higher in               P. deltoides               than in               P. simonii               . GO annotation and enrichment analysis of those genes harboring InDels showed the same patterns between the two poplar species. It is interesting to find that the ratio ({\textasciitilde}\,46\%) of the common InDels within genes to all common InDels was higher than that of the InDels within genes to all InDels in               P. deltoides               ({\textasciitilde}\,35\%) or in               P. simonii               ({\textasciitilde}\,34\%), possibly indicating that those InDels are more conservative between poplar species. Moreover, investigation of the InDel segregation patterns demonstrated that a large number of Mendelian InDels could be selected for genetic mapping in the F               1               hybrid population. RAD-seq provides genome-wide insights into the InDel distributions in               P. deltoides               and               P. simonii               and the segregation patterns in their progeny, providing valuable genomic variation information for genetic and evolutionary studies in               Populus               .},

  abstract = {Detecting genomic regions under selection is an important objective of population genetics. Typical analyses for this goal are based on exploiting genetic diversity patterns in present time data but rapid advances in DNA sequencing have increased the availability of time series genomic data. A common approach to analyze such data is to model the temporal evolution of an allele frequency as a Markov chain. Based on this principle, several methods have been proposed to infer selection intensity. One of their differences lies in how they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Using the Wright-Fisher model is a natural choice but its computational cost is prohibitive for large population sizes so approximations to this model based on parametric distributions have been proposed. Here, we compared the performance of some of these approximations with respect to their power to detect selection and their estimation of the selection coefficient. We developped a new generic Hidden Markov Model likelihood calculator and applied it on genetic time series simulated under various evolutionary scenarios. The Beta with spikes approximation, which combines discrete fixation probabilities with a continuous Beta distribution, was found to perform consistently better than the others. This distribution provides an almost perfect fit to the Wright-Fisher model in terms of selection inference, for a computational cost that does not increase with population size. We further evaluated this model for population sizes not accessible to the Wright-Fisher model and illustrated its performance on a dataset of two divergently selected chicken populations.},

  abstract = {Large, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data sets containing families provide an important opportunity to identify crossovers and shared genetic material in siblings. However, the high variant calling error rates of WGS in some areas of the genome can result in spurious crossover calls, and the special inheritance status of the X Chromosome presents challenges. We have developed a hidden Markov model that addresses these issues by modeling the inheritance of variants in families in the presence of error-prone regions and inherited deletions. We call our method PhasingFamilies. We validate PhasingFamilies using the platinum genome family NA1281 (precision: 0.81; recall: 0.97), as well as simulated genomes with known crossover positions (precision: 0.93; recall: 0.92). Using 1925 quads from the Simons Simplex Collection, we found that PhasingFamilies resolves crossovers to a median resolution of 3527.5 bp. These crossovers recapitulate existing recombination rate maps, including for the X Chromosome; produce sibling pair IBD that matches expected distributions; and are validated by the haplotype estimation tool SHAPEIT. We provide an efficient, open-source implementation of PhasingFamilies that can be used to identify crossovers from family sequencing data.},

However, its utilization for breeding has lagged behind other crops due to limited genetic and genomic resources. In this study, next-generation sequencing was first used to survey the genome of napiergrass. Napiergrass sequences displayed high synteny to the pearl millet genome and showed expansions in the pearl millet genome along with genomic rearrangements between the two genomes. An average repeat content of 27.5\% was observed in napiergrass including 5,339 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Furthermore, to construct a high-density genetic map of napiergrass, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was employed in a bi-parental population of 185 F               1               hybrids. A total of 512 million high quality reads were generated and 287,093 SNPs were called by using multiple               de-novo               and reference-based SNP callers. Single dose SNPs were used to construct the first high-density linkage map that resulted in 1,913 SNPs mapped to 14 linkage groups, spanning a length of 1,410\,cM and a density of 1 marker per 0.73\,cM. This map can be used for many further genetic and genomic studies in napiergrass and related species.},

  abstract = {Background: To explore the potential value of high-throughput genotyping assays in the analysis of large and complex genomes, we designed two highly multiplexed Illumina bead arrays using the GoldenGate SNP assay for gene mapping in white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) and black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.). Results: Each array included 768 SNPs, identified by resequencing genomic DNA from parents of each mapping population. For white spruce and black spruce, respectively, 69.2\% and 77.1\% of genotyped SNPs had valid GoldenGate assay scores and segregated in the mapping populations. For each of these successful SNPs, on average, valid genotyping scores were obtained for over 99\% of progeny. SNP data were integrated to pre-existing ALFP, ESTP, and SSR markers to construct two individual linkage maps and a composite map for white spruce and black spruce genomes. The white spruce composite map contained 821 markers including 348 gene loci. Also, 835 markers including 328 gene loci were positioned on the black spruce composite map. In total, 215 anchor markers (mostly gene markers) were shared between the two species. Considering lineage divergence at least 10 Myr ago between the two spruces, interspecific comparison of homoeologous linkage groups revealed remarkable synteny and marker colinearity. Conclusion: The design of customized highly multiplexed Illumina SNP arrays appears as an efficient procedure to enhance the mapping of expressed genes and make linkage maps more informative and powerful in such species with poorly known genomes. This genotyping approach will open new avenues for co-localizing candidate genes and QTLs, partial genome sequencing, and comparative mapping across conifers.},

Draft genome sequences of white spruce and other conifers have recently been produced, but dense genetic maps are needed to comprehend genome macrostructure, delineate regions involved in quantitative traits, complement functional genomic investigations, and assist the assembly of fragmented genomic sequences. A greatly expanded P. glauca composite linkage map was generated from a set of 1976 full-sib progeny, with the positioning of 8793 expressed genes. Regions with significant low or high gene density were identified. Gene family members tended to be mapped on the same chromosomes, with tandemly arrayed genes significantly biased towards specific functional classes. The map was integrated with transcriptome data surveyed across eight tissues. In total, 69 clusters of co-expressed and co-localising genes were identified. A high level of synteny was found with pine genetic maps, which should facilitate the transfer of structural information in the Pinaceae. Although the current white spruce genome sequence remains highly fragmented, dozens of scaffolds encompassing more than one mapped gene were identified. From these, the relationship between genetic and physical distances was examined and the genome-wide recombination rate was found to be much smaller than most estimates reported for angiosperm genomes. This gene linkage map shall assist the large-scale assembly of the next-generation white spruce genome sequence and provide a reference resource for the conifer genomics community.},

While much light has been shed on the mechanisms and rate of genome evolution in flowering plants, such knowledge remains conspicuously meagre for the gymnosperms. Conifers are key representatives of gymnosperms and the sheer size of their genomes represents a significant challenge for characterization, sequencing and assembling. Results: To gain insight into the macro-organisation and long-term evolution of the conifer genome, we developed a genetic map involving 1,801 spruce genes. We designed a statistical approach based on kernel density estimation to analyse gene density and identified seven gene-rich isochors. Groups of co-localizing genes were also found that were transcriptionally co-regulated, indicative of functional clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of 157 gene families for which at least two duplicates were mapped on the spruce genome indicated that ancient gene duplicates shared by angiosperms and gymnosperms outnumbered conifer-specific duplicates by a ratio of eight to one. Ancient duplicates were much more translocated within and among spruce chromosomes than conifer-specific duplicates, which were mostly organised in tandem arrays. Both high synteny and collinearity were also observed between the genomes of spruce and pine, two conifers that diverged more than 100 million years ago. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that much genomic evolution has occurred in the seed plant lineage before the split between gymnosperms and angiosperms, and that the pace of evolution of the genome macro-structure has been much slower in the gymnosperm lineage leading to extent conifers than that seen for the same period of time in flowering plants. This trend is largely congruent with the contrasted rates of diversification and morphological evolution observed between these two groups of seed plants.},

  abstract = {Proper number and placement of meiotic crossovers is vital to chromosome segregation, with failures in normal crossover distribution often resulting in aneuploidy and infertility. Meiotic crossovers are formed via homologous repair of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although DSBs occur throughout the genome, crossover placement is intricately patterned, as observed first in early genetic studies by Muller and Sturtevant. Three types of patterning events have been identified. Interference, first described by Sturtevant in 1915, is a phenomenon in which crossovers on the same chromosome do not occur near one another. Assurance, initially identified by Owen in 1949, describes the phenomenon in which a minimum of one crossover is formed per chromosome pair. Suppression, first observed by Beadle in 1932, dictates that crossovers do not occur in regions surrounding the centromere and telomeres. The mechanisms behind crossover patterning remain largely unknown, and key players appear to act at all scales, from the DNA level to inter-chromosome interactions. There is also considerable overlap between the known players that drive each patterning phenomenon. In this review we discuss the history of studies of crossover patterning, developments in methods used in the field, and our current understanding of the interplay between patterning phenomena.},

Here, a 6K SNP array for use with the Illumina InfiniumH system was developed for diploid sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and allotetraploid sour cherry (P. cerasus). This effort was led by RosBREED, a community initiative to enable marker-assisted breeding for rosaceous crops. Next-generation sequencing in diverse breeding germplasm provided 25 billion basepairs (Gb) of cherry DNA sequence from which were identified genome-wide SNPs for sweet cherry and for the two sour cherry subgenomes derived from sweet cherry (avium subgenome) and P. fruticosa (fruticosa subgenome). Anchoring to the peach genome sequence, recently released by the International Peach Genome Initiative, predicted relative physical locations of the 1.9 million putative SNPs detected, preliminarily filtered to 368,943 SNPs. Further filtering was guided by results of a 144-SNP subset examined with the Illumina GoldenGateH assay on 160 accessions. A 6K InfiniumH II array was designed with SNPs evenly spaced genetically across the sweet and sour cherry genomes. SNPs were developed for each sour cherry subgenome by using minor allele frequency in the sour cherry detection panel to enrich for subgenome-specific SNPs followed by targeting to either subgenome according to alleles observed in sweet cherry. The array was evaluated using panels of sweet (n = 269) and sour (n = 330) cherry breeding germplasm. Approximately one third of array SNPs were informative for each crop. A total of 1825 polymorphic SNPs were verified in sweet cherry, 13\% of these originally developed for sour cherry. Allele dosage was resolved for 2058 polymorphic SNPs in sour cherry, one third of these being originally developed for sweet cherry. This publicly available genomics resource represents a significant advance in cherry genome-scanning capability that will accelerate marker-locus-trait association discovery, genome structure investigation, and genetic diversity assessment in this diploid-tetraploid crop group.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination by crossovers (COs) is tightly regulated, limiting its key role in producing genetic diversity. However, while COs are usually restricted in number and not homogenously distributed along chromosomes, we show here how to disrupt these rules in Brassica species by using allotriploid hybrids (AAC, 2n = 3x = 29), resulting from the cross between the allotetraploid rapeseed (B. napus, AACC, 2n = 4x = 38) and one of its diploid progenitors (B. rapa, AA, 2n = 2x = 20). We produced mapping populations from different genotypes of both diploid AA and triploid AAC hybrids, used as female and/or as male. Each population revealed nearly 3,000 COs that we studied with SNP markers well distributed along the A genome (on average 1 SNP per 1.25 Mbp). Compared to the case of diploids, allotriploid hybrids showed 1.7 to 3.4 times more overall COs depending on the sex of meiosis and the genetic background. Most surprisingly, we found that such a rise was always associated with (i) dramatic changes in the shape of recombination landscapes and (ii) a strong decrease of CO interference. Hybrids carrying an additional C genome exhibited COs all along the A chromosomes, even in the vicinity of centromeres that are deprived of COs in diploids as well as in most studied species. Moreover, in male allotriploid hybrids we found that Class I COs are mostly responsible for the changes of CO rates, landscapes and interference. These results offer the opportunity for geneticists and plant breeders to dramatically enhance the generation of diversity in Brassica species by disrupting the linkage drag coming from limits on number and distribution of COs.},

  abstract = {The superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, is one of the most iconic Australian passerine species. This species belongs to an endemic Australasian clade, Meliphagides, which diversified early in the evolution of the oscine passerines. Today, the oscine passerines comprise almost half of all avian species diversity. Despite the rapid increase of available bird genome assemblies, this part of the avian tree has not yet been represented by a high-quality reference. To rectify that, we present the first high-quality genome assembly of a Meliphagides representative: the superb fairy-wren. We combined Illumina shotgun and mate-pair sequences, PacBio long-reads, and a genetic linkage map from an intensively sampled pedigree of a wild population to generate this genome assembly. Of the final assembled 1.07-Gb genome, 975 Mb (90.4\%) was anchored onto 25 pseudochromosomes resulting in a final superscaffold N50 of 68.11 Mb. This high-quality bird genome assembly is one of only a handful which is also accompanied by a genetic map and recombination landscape. In comparison to other pedigree-based bird genetic maps, we find that the fairy-wren genetic map more closely resembles those of Taeniopygia guttata and Parus major maps, unlike the Ficedula albicollis map which more closely resembles that of Gallus gallus. Lastly, we also provide a predictive gene and repeat annotation of the genome assembly. This new high-quality, annotated genome assembly will be an invaluable resource not only regarding the superb fairy-wren species and relatives but also broadly across the avian tree by providing a novel reference point for comparative genomic analyses.},

  abstract = {Background: Melon shows a broad diversity in fruit morphology and quality, which is still underexploited in breeding programs. The knowledge of the genetic basis of fruit quality traits is important for identifying new alleles that may be introduced in elite material by highly efficient molecular breeding tools. Results: In order to identify QTLs controlling fruit quality, a recombinant inbred line population was developed using two commercial cultivars as parental lines: ``V{\'e}drantais'', from the cantalupensis group, and ``Piel de Sapo'', from the inodorus group. Both have desirable quality traits for the market, but their fruits differ in traits such as rind and flesh color, sugar content, ripening behavior, size and shape. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy to construct a dense genetic map, which included around five thousand variants distributed in 824 bins. The RIL population was phenotyped for quality and morphology traits, and we mapped 33 stable QTLs involved in sugar and carotenoid content, fruit and seed morphology and major loci controlling external color of immature fruit and mottled rind. The median confidence interval of the QTLs was 942 kb, suggesting that the high density of the genetic map helped in increasing the mapping resolution. Some of these intervals contained less than a hundred annotated genes, and an integrative strategy combining gene expression and resequencing data enabled identification of candidate genes for some of these traits. Conclusion: Several QTLs controlling fruit quality traits in melon were identified and delimited to narrow genomic intervals, using a RIL population and a GBS-based genetic map.},

Currently, there is no clear indication of which method, among the many different ones reported in literature, is the most adequate to infer karyotype asymmetry (especially intrachromosomal), above all in view of the criticisms recently moved to the most recent proposal published. This work addresses a critical review of the methods so far proposed for estimation of karyotype asymmetry, using both artificial and real chromosome datasets. It is shown once again how the concept karyotype of asymmetry is composed by two kinds of estimation: interchromosomal and intrachromosomal asymmetries. For the first one, the use of Coefficient of Variation of Chromosome Length, a powerful statistical parameter, is here confirmed. For the second one, the most appropriate parameter is the new Mean Centromeric Asymmetry, where Centromeric Asymmetry for each chromosome in a complement is easily obtained by calculating the difference of relative lengths of long arm and short arm. The Coefficient of Variation of Centromeric Index, strongly criticized in recent literature, is an additional karyological parameter, not properly connected with karyotype asymmetry. This shows definitively what and how to measure to correctly infer karyotype asymmetry, by proposing to couple two already known parameters in a new way. Hopefully, it will be the basic future reference for all those scientists dealing with cytotaxonomy.},

Here, we analyzed 36 completely sequenced genomes representing four of the five major groups in eukaryotes (Unikonts, Excavates, Chromalveolates and Plantae). gBGC was investigated by directly comparing GC content and recombination rates in species where recombination data are available, that is, half of them. To study all species of our dataset, we used chromosome size as a proxy for recombination rate and compared it with GC content. Among the 17 species showing a significant relationship between GC content and chromosome size, 15 are consistent with the predictions of the gBGC model. Importantly, the species showing a pattern consistent with gBGC are found in all the four major groups of eukaryotes studied, which suggests that gBGC may be widespread in eukaryotes.},

Recent years have seen progress in quantifying recombination rate evolution across multiple temporal and genomic scales.

To address this notable gap, we used immunofluorescent cytology to quantify genome-wide recombination rates in males from a wild population of the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. For comparison, we measured recombination rates in a second population of male P. leucopus raised in the laboratory and in male deer mice from the subspecies Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii. Although we found differences between individuals in the genome-wide recombination rate, levels of variation were low{\textemdash}within populations, between populations, and between species. Quantification of synaptonemal complex length and crossover positions along chromosome 1 using a novel automated approach also revealed conservation in broad-scale crossover patterning, including strong crossover interference. We propose stabilizing selection targeting recombination or correlated processes as the explanation for these patterns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In most species that reproduce sexually, successful gametogenesis requires recombination during meiosis. The number and placement of crossovers (COs) vary among individuals, with females and males often presenting the most striking contrasts. Despite the recognition that the sexes recombine at different rates (heterochiasmy), existing data fail to answer the question of whether patterns of genetic variation in recombination rate are similar in the two sexes. To fill this gap, we measured the genome-wide recombination rate in both sexes from a panel of wild-derived inbred strains from multiple subspecies of house mice (Mus musculus) and from a few additional species of Mus. To directly compare recombination rates in females and males from the same genetic backgrounds, we applied established methods based on immunolocalization of recombination proteins to inbred strains. Our results reveal discordant patterns of genetic variation in the two sexes. Whereas male genome-wide recombination rates vary substantially among strains, female recombination rates measured in the same strains are more static. The direction of heterochiasmy varies within two subspecies, Mus musculus molossinus and Mus musculus musculus. The direction of sex differences in the length of the synaptonemal complex and CO positions is consistent across strains and does not track sex differences in genome-wide recombination rate. In males, contrasts between strains with high recombination rate and strains with low recombination rate suggest more recombination is associated with stronger CO interference and more double-strand breaks. The sex-specific patterns of genetic variation we report underscore the importance of incorporating sex differences into recombination research.},

  abstract = {We explored the evolution of recombination under antagonistic coevolution, concentrating on the equilibrium frequencies of modifier alleles causing recombination in initially nonrecombining populations. We found that the equilibrium level of recombination in the host depended not only on parasite virulence, but also on the strength of the modifier allele, and on whether or not the modifier was physically linked to the parasite interaction loci. Nonetheless, the maximum level of recombination for linked loci at equilibrium was about 0.3 (60\% of free recombination) for interactions with highly virulent parasites; the level decreased for unlinked modifiers, and for lower levels of parasite virulence. We conclude that recombination spreads because it provides a combination of an immediate (next-generation) fitness benefit and a delayed (two or more generations) increase in the rate of response to directional selection. The relative impact of these two mechanisms depends on the virulence of parasites early in the spread of the modifier, but a trade-off between the two dictates the equilibrium modifier frequency for all nonzero virulences that we examined. In addition, population mean fitness was higher in populations at intermediate equilibria than populations fixed for free recombination or no recombination. The difference, however, was not enough on its own to overcome the two-fold cost of producing males.},

A genome-wide association study revealed three major loci affecting inter-individual variation in recombination rate, including the R NF212, HEI10 and K CNJ15 genes. Finally, we compared our results to those obtained previously in a distantly related population of domestic sheep, the Soay. This comparison revealed on one hand that Soay and Lacaune sheep have similar genetic determinant of total recombination rate while confirming that Soay sheep have experienced strong selection greatly increasing their recombination rate. Taken together these observations highlight that multiple genetically independent pathways affect recombination rate.},

The two data sets were thus combined to create more precise male meiotic recombination maps in Sheep.

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are the primary contributors to the genome bulk in many organisms and are major players in genome evolution. A clear and thorough understanding of the population dynamics of TEs is therefore essential for full comprehension of the eukaryotic genome evolution and function. Although TEs in Drosophila melanogaster have received much attention, population dynamics of most TE families in this species remains entirely unexplored. It is not clear whether the same population processes can account for the population behaviors of all TEs in Drosophila or whether, as has been suggested previously, different orders behave according to very different rules. In this work, we analyzed population frequencies for a large number of individual TEs (755 TEs) in five North American and one sub-Saharan African D. melanogaster populations (75 strains in total). These TEs have been annotated in the reference D. melanogaster euchromatic genome and have been sampled from all three major orders (non-LTR, LTR, and TIR) and from all families with more than 20 TE copies (55 families in total). We find strong evidence that TEs in Drosophila across all orders and families are subject to purifying selection at the level of ectopic recombination. We showed that strength of this selection varies predictably with recombination rate, length of individual TEs, and copy number and length of other TEs in the same family. Importantly, these rules do not appear to vary across orders. Finally, we built a statistical model that considered only individual TE-level (such as the TE length) and family-level properties (such as the copy number) and were able to explain more than 40\% of the variation in TE frequencies in D. melanogaster.},

  abstract = {Family studies can be used to measure the genetic distance between same-chromosome (syntenic) STRs in order to detect physical linkage or linkage disequilibrium. However, family studies are expensive and time consuming, in many cases uninformative, and lack a reliable means to infer the phase of the diplotypes obtained. HapMap provides a more comprehensive and fine-scale estimation of recombination rates using high density multi-point SNP data (average inter-SNP distance: 900 nucleotides). Data at this fine scale detects sub-kilobase genetic distances across the whole recombining human genome. We have used the most recent HapMap SNP data release 22 to measure and compare genetic distances, and by inference finescale recombination rates, between 29 syntenic STR pairs identified from 39 validated STRs currently available for forensic use. The 39 STRs comprise 23 core loci: SE33, Penta D \& E, 13 CODIS and 7 non-CODIS European Standard Set STRs, plus supplementary STRs in the recently released Promega CS-7TM and Qiagen Investigator HDplexTM kits. Also included were D9S1120, a marker we developed for forensic use unique to chromosome 9, and the novel D6S1043 component STR of SinoFilerTM (Applied Biosystems). The data collated provides reliable estimates of recombination rates between each STR pair, that can then be placed into haplotype frequency calculators for short pedigrees with multiple meiotic inputs and which just requires the addition of allele frequencies. This allows all current STR sets or their combinations to be used in supplemented paternity analyses without the need for further adjustment for physical linkage. The detailed analysis of recombination rates made for autosomal forensic STRs was extended to the more than 50 X chromosome STRs established or in development for complex kinship analyses.},

  abstract = {Plant mating systems play a key role in structuring genetic variation both within and between species. In hybrid zones, the outcomes and dynamics of hybridization are usually interpreted as the balance between gene flow and selection against hybrids. Yet, mating systems can introduce selective forces that alter these expectations; with diverse outcomes for the level and direction of gene flow depending on variation in outcrossing and whether the mating systems of the species pair are the same or divergent. We present a survey of hybridization in 133 species pairs from 41 plant families and examine how patterns of hybridization vary with mating system. We examine if hybrid zone mode, level of gene flow, asymmetries in gene flow and the frequency of reproductive isolating barriers vary in relation to mating system/s of the species pair. We combine these results with a simulation model and examples from the literature to address two general themes: (1) the two-way interaction between introgression and the evolution of reproductive systems, and (2) how mating system can facilitate or restrict interspecific gene flow. We conclude that examining mating system with hybridization provides unique opportunities to understand divergence and the processes underlying reproductive isolation.},

  abstract = {Background: Angiosperm sex chromosomes, where present, are generally recently evolved. The key step in initiating the development of sex chromosomes from autosomes is the establishment of a sex-determining locus within a region of non-recombination. To better understand early sex chromosome evolution, it is important to determine the process by which recombination is suppressed around the sex determining genes. We have used the dioecious angiosperm kiwifruit Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis, which has an active-Y sex chromosome system, to study recombination rates around the sex locus, to better understand key events in the development of sex chromosomes. Results: We have confirmed the sex-determining region (SDR) in A. chinensis var. chinensis, using a combination of high density genetic mapping and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) of Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) linked to the sex markers onto pachytene chromosomes. The SDR is a subtelomeric non-recombining region adjacent to the nucleolar organiser region (NOR). A region of restricted recombination of around 6 Mbp in size in both male and female maps spans the SDR and covers around a third of chromosome 25. Conclusions: As recombination is suppressed over a similar region between X chromosomes and between and X and Y chromosomes, we propose that recombination is suppressed in this region because of the proximity of the NOR and the centromere, with both the NOR and centromere suppressing recombination, and this predates suppressed recombination due to differences between X and Y chromosomes. Such regions of suppressed recombination in the genome provide an opportunity for the evolution of sex chromosomes, if a sex-determining locus develops there or translocates into this region.},

  abstract = {Background: Angiosperm sex chromosomes, where present, are generally recently evolved. The key step in initiating the development of sex chromosomes from autosomes is the establishment of a sex-determining locus within a region of non-recombination. To better understand early sex chromosome evolution, it is important to determine the process by which recombination is suppressed around the sex determining genes. We have used the dioecious angiosperm kiwifruit Actinidia chinensis var. chinensis, which has an active-Y sex chromosome system, to study recombination rates around the sex locus, to better understand key events in the development of sex chromosomes. Results: We have confirmed the sex-determining region (SDR) in A. chinensis var. chinensis, using a combination of high density genetic mapping and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) of Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) linked to the sex markers onto pachytene chromosomes. The SDR is a subtelomeric non-recombining region adjacent to the nucleolar organiser region (NOR). A region of restricted recombination of around 6 Mbp in size in both male and female maps spans the SDR and covers around a third of chromosome 25. Conclusions: As recombination is suppressed over a similar region between X chromosomes and between and X and Y chromosomes, we propose that recombination is suppressed in this region because of the proximity of the NOR and the centromere, with both the NOR and centromere suppressing recombination, and this predates suppressed recombination due to differences between X and Y chromosomes. Such regions of suppressed recombination in the genome provide an opportunity for the evolution of sex chromosomes, if a sex-determining locus develops there or translocates into this region.},

  abstract = {Results: A second genome of an A. chinensis (genotype Red5) was fully sequenced. This new sequence resulted in a 554.0 Mb assembly with all but 6 Mb assigned to pseudo-chromosomes. Pseudo-chromosomal comparisons showed a considerable number of translocation events have occurred following a whole genome duplication (WGD) event some consistent with centromeric Robertsonian-like translocations. RNA sequencing data from 12 tissues and ab initio analysis informed a genome-wide manual annotation, using the WebApollo tool. In total, 33,044 gene loci represented by 33,123 isoforms were identified, named and tagged for quality of evidential support. Of these 3114 (9.4\%) were identical to a protein within `Hongyang' The Kiwifruit Information Resource (KIR v2). Some proportion of the differences will be varietal polymorphisms. However, as most computationally predicted Red5 models required manual re-annotation this proportion is expected to be small. The quality of the new gene models was tested by fully sequencing 550 cloned `Hort16A' cDNAs and comparing with the predicted protein models for Red5 and both the original `Hongyang' assembly and the revised annotation from KIR v2. Only 48.9\% and 63.5\% of the cDNAs had a match with 90\% identity or better to the original and revised `Hongyang' annotation, respectively, compared with 90.9\% to the Red5 models. Conclusions: Our study highlights the need to take a cautious approach to draft genomes and computationally predicted genes. Our use of the manual annotation tool WebApollo facilitated manual checking and correction of gene models enabling improvement of computational prediction. This utility was especially relevant for certain types of gene families such as the EXPANSIN like genes. Finally, this high quality gene set will supply the kiwifruit and general plant community with a new tool for genomics and other comparative analysis.},

  abstract = {The contradiction between the long-term persistence of the chromosomal hotspots that initiate meiotic recombination and the self-destructive mechanism by which they act strongly suggests that our understanding of recombination is incomplete. This ``hotspot paradox'' has been reinforced by the finding that biased gene conversion also removes active hotspots from human sperm. To investigate the requirements for hotspot persistence, we developed a detailed computer simulation model of their activity and its evolutionary consequences. With this model, unopposed hotspot activity could drive strong hotspots from 50\% representation to extinction within 70 generations. Although the crossing over that hotspots cause can increase population fitness, this benefit was always too small to slow the loss of hotspots. Hotspots could not be maintained by plausible rates of de novo mutation, nor by crossover interference, which alters the frequency and/or spacing of crossovers. Competition among hotspots for activity-limiting factors also did not prevent their extinction, although the rate of hotspot loss was slowed. Key factors were the probability that the initiating hotspot allele is destroyed and the nonmeiotic contributions hotspots make to fitness. Experimental investigation of these deserves high priority, because until the paradox is resolved all components of the mechanism are open to doubt.},

We undertake both selective sweep analyses and genome wide association studies (GWAS) inclusive of over 144 modern breeds, 54 wild canids and a hundred village dogs. Our results identify variants of strong impact associated with 16 phenotypes, including body weight variation which, when combined with existing data, explain greater than 90\% of body size variation in dogs. We thus demonstrate that GWAS and selection scans performed with WGS are powerful complementary methods for expanding the utility of companion animal systems for the study of mammalian growth and biology.},

  abstract = {The centromere is a chromosomal locus responsible for the faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division. It has become evident that centromeres can be established literally on any DNA sequence, and the possible synergy between DNA sequences and the most prominent centromere identifiers, protein components, and epigenetic marks remains uncertain. However, some evolutionary preferences seem to exist, and long-term established centromeres are frequently formed on long arrays of satellite DNAs and/or transposable elements. Recent progress in understanding functional centromere sequences is based largely on the high-resolution DNA mapping of sequences that interact with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, the most reliable marker of active centromeres. In addition, sequence assembly and mapping of large repetitive centromeric regions, as well as comparative genome analyses offer insight into their complex organization and evolution. The rapidly advancing field of transcription in centromere regions highlights the functional importance of centromeric transcripts. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of knowledge on the composition and functionality of DNA sequences underlying active centromeres and discuss their contribution to the functioning of different centromere types in higher eukaryotes.},

We explore how linkage, epistasis, and maladaptive gene flow affect the invasion probability of weakly beneficial de-novo mutations that arise on the island at an arbitrary physical distance to a locus that already maintains a stable migration-selection polymorphism. By assuming a slightly supercritical branching process, we deduce explicit conditions on the parameters that permit a positive invasion probability and we derive approximations for it. They show how the invasion probability depends on the additive and epistatic effects of the mutant, on its linkage to the polymorphism, and on the migration rate. We use these approximations together with empirically motivated distributions of epistatic effects to analyze the influence of epistasis on the expected invasion probability if mutants are drawn randomly from such a distribution and occur at a random physical distance to the existing polymorphism. We find that the invasion probability generally increases as the epistasis parameter increases or the migration rate decreases, but not necessarily as the recombination rate decreases. Finally, we shed light on the size of emerging genomic islands of divergence by exploring the size of the chromosomal neighborhood of the already established polymorphism in which 50\% or 90\% of the successfully invading mutations become established. These 'window sizes' always decrease in a reverse sigmoidal way with stronger migration and typically increase with increasing epistatic effect.},

  abstract = {Disentangling the effect on genomic diversity of natural selection from that of demography is notoriously difficult, but necessary to properly reconstruct the history of species. Here, we use high-quality human genomic data to show that purifying selection at linked sites (i.e. background selection, BGS) and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) together affect as much as 95\% of the variants of our genome. We find that the magnitude and relative importance of BGS and gBGC are largely determined by variation in recombination rate and base composition. Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases. However, by conditioning on genomic regions with recombination rates above 1.5 cM/Mb and mutation types (C{$\leftrightarrow$}G, A{$\leftrightarrow$}T), we identify a set of SNPs that is mostly unaffected by BGS or gBGC, and that avoids these biases in the reconstruction of human history.           ,              Human chromosomes are made up of DNA, which contains about 3 billion `letters' that carry the instructions needed to build and maintain an individual. However, only about 10 percent of the human genome is made up of genes that code for proteins, or have a defined role in the body. The DNA sequence is largely the same in all people, but some modifications {\textendash} or variants {\textendash} occur about every hundred letters. These produce different versions of the same gene, which give us our unique features, such as the color of our hair or eyes.             The frequencies of some genetic variants can change over time, which makes human populations diverge genetically and physically. This can happen through different mechanisms. Positive selection keeps variants that are beneficial in specific environments, while negative selection removes genetic changes that are detrimental, for example because they cause disease. Transmission bias favors one of the two variants from our two parents. Chance alters the frequencies of neutral variants, which are neither good nor bad for the individual.             It is important to distinguish between these different scenarios, as they inform us about the forces that act on human evolution. For example, neutral variants tell us about the demography and migration patterns between populations. Variants under negative selection reveal which genetic areas are under pressure to stay the same because they are important for the organism to function correctly. Until now, it was unclear how we could best identify the variants affected by different evolutionary pressures, and how much of the genome was under negative selection.             Pouyet, Aeschbacher et al. created a measure of genetic diversity that is only affected by selection or transmission bias. The results showed that negative selection influences as much as 85 percent of our genome, whereas transmission bias affects a majority of the rest of the genome. After removing these two biases, less than 5 percent of the human genome is found to evolve by chance. This suggests that while most of our genetic material is formed of non-functional sequences, the vast majority of it evolves indirectly under some type of selection.             These findings define which parts of our genome evolves neutrally and can therefore be used to correctly reconstruct the past demography and migration events of humans around the world.

  abstract = {Synonymous codon usage (SCU) varies widely among human genes. In particular, genes involved in different functional categories display a distinct codon usage, which was interpreted as evidence that SCU is adaptively constrained to optimize translation efficiency in distinct cellular states. We demonstrate here that SCU is not driven by constraints on tRNA abundance, but by large-scale variation in GC-content, caused by meiotic recombination, via the non-adaptive process of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Expression in meiotic cells is associated with a strong decrease in recombination within genes. Differences in SCU among functional categories reflect differences in levels of meiotic transcription, which is linked to variation in recombination and therefore in gBGC. Overall, the gBGC model explains 70\% of the variance in SCU among genes. We argue that the strong heterogeneity of SCU induced by gBGC in mammalian genomes precludes any optimization of the tRNA pool to the demand in codon usage.},

In mice, we recently reported two independently produced point mutations at the same residue, glu360pro (             Prdm9             EP             ) and glu360lys (             Prdm9             EK             ), which severely reduce its H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase activities             in vivo. Prdm9             EP             is slightly less hypomorphic than             Prdm9             EK             , but both mutations reduce both the number and amplitude of PRDM9-dependent H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks in spermatocytes. While both mutations cause infertility with complete meiotic arrest in males,             Prdm9             EP             , but not             Prdm9             EK             , is compatible with some female fertility. When we tested the effects of these mutations             in vitro             , both             Prdm9             EP             and             Prdm9             EK             abolished H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase activity in full-length PRDM9. However, in the isolated PRDM9 PR/SET domain, these mutations selectively compromised H3K36 methyltransferase activity, while leaving H3K4 methyltransferase activity intact. The difference in these effects on the PR/SET domain versus the full-length protein show that PRDM9 is not an intrinsically modular enzyme; its catalytic domain is influenced by its tertiary structure and possibly by its interactions with DNA and other proteins             in vivo             . These two informative mutations illuminate the enzymatic chemistry of PRDM9, and potentially of PR/SET domains in general, reveal the minimal threshold of PRDM9-dependent catalytic activity for female fertility, and potentially have some practical utility for genetic mapping and genomics.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are introduced in meiosis to initiate recombination and generate crossovers, the reciprocal exchanges of genetic material between parental chromosomes. Here, we present high-resolution maps of meiotic DSBs in individual human genomes. Comparing DSB maps between individuals shows that along with DNA binding by PRDM9, additional factors may dictate the efficiency of DSB formation. We find evidence for both GC-biased gene conversion and mutagenesis around meiotic DSB hotspots, while frequent colocalization of DSB hotspots with chromosome rearrangement breakpoints implicates the aberrant repair of meiotic DSBs in genomic disorders. Furthermore, our data indicate that DSB frequency is a major determinant of crossover rate. These maps provide new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination and the impact of meiotic recombination on genome function.           ,                             Mapping human male meiotic recombination sites reveals their influence on genome evolution and genetic disease.

The haploid germ cells must undergo a special cell division, meiosis, which halves their DNA content. Meiosis involves a DNA recombination step between parental chromosomes. Recombination is initiated by a DNA double-strand break, which can exchange DNA between the chromosomes, a process that drives human genetic variation. Pratto               et al.               mapped meiotic recombination sites in individual human males (see the Perspective by de Massy). Recombination hotspots were influenced by variants of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase protein, PRDM9, as well as by other factors. The recombination sites also influence genome evolution and the incidence of genetic disease.

The map contains 101 RFLP and 34 AFLP markers on 17 linkage groups covering 1680 cM. Also presented is the approximate mapping position of a further four RFLP and 75 AFLP markers, which either could not be given a unique place on the map or for which the available data is not sufficient to allow confident positioning, and the result of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of traits related to root-penetration ability. Root penetration was assessed by counting the number of root axes that penetrated a 3 mm-thick layer consisting of 80\% wax and 20\% white soft paraffin. Good root penetration would be expected to increase drought resistance where soil strength is high. Single-marker analysis revealed seven QTLs for the number of roots which penetrate the wax layer. In identical locations were seven QTLs for the ratio of penetrated to the total number of roots. Transgressive inheritance of positive alleles from Bala explained four of these QTLs. Comparison of the QTLs identified here with previous reports of QTLs for root morphology suggest that alleles which improve root penetration ability may also either make the roots longer or thicker.},

  abstract = {To follow the dynamics of meiosis in the model plant Arabidopsis, we have established a live cell imaging setup to observe male meiocytes. Our method is based on the concomitant visualization of microtubules (MTs) and a meiotic cohesin subunit that allows following five cellular parameters: cell shape, MT array, nucleus position, nucleolus position, and chromatin condensation. We find that the states of these parameters are not randomly associated and identify 11 cellular states, referred to as landmarks, which occur much more frequently than closely related ones, indicating that they are convergence points during meiotic progression. As a first application of our system, we revisited a previously identified mutant in the meiotic A-type cyclin TARDY ASYNCHRONOUS MEIOSIS (TAM). Our imaging system enabled us to reveal both qualitatively and quantitatively altered landmarks in tam, foremost the formation of previously not recognized ectopic spindle- or phragmoplast-like structures that arise without attachment to chromosomes.           ,              In plant cells, as in other cells, genetic information is stored within structures known as chromosomes. Most of the cells in a plant contain a duplicated set of chromosomes that the plant needs to survive. However, plants also produce some cells known as sex cells that only have a single set of chromosomes. This ensures that, when plants sexually reproduce, a male and female sex cell will fuse together and eventually grow into a new plant that carries a doubled set of chromosomes.             Cells known as meiocytes make sex cells by dividing through a process known as meiosis. Previous studies have identified several genes that regulate meiosis in plants. For example, a gene known as TAM is required to make sex cells in a small weed known as Arabidopsis thaliana, which is often used as a model plant in research studies.             During meiosis, meiocytes need to copy and move their chromosomes at precisely the right time to ensure that each sex cell they produce has a complete set of chromosomes. Studies of how chromosomes behave during meiosis in plants have so far almost exclusively relied on traditional microscopy techniques that kill the cells in the process of preparing them for imaging. Before being placed under a microscope, the dead cell material is often spread out to make it easier to see the chromosomes. These techniques provide snapshots of meiosis that provide good spatial resolution of chromosome behavior, but information about how chromosomes and other cellular components behave in the course of meiosis is lost.             Prusicki et al. developed a new microscopy approach to observe meiosis in living A. thaliana cells. The experiments found that the structure of all the cells changed during meiosis in several distinct stages (referred to as `landmarks'). Some of these landmarks were absent or happened at a different time in mutant plant cells that lacked the TAM gene. As a result, a structure called the spindle that is required to move chromosomes during meiosis formed at the wrong time in the mutant cells.             The findings of Prusicki et al. reveal new insights into the role of TAM in meiosis. The next step following on from this work is to use the same approach to study other mutant plants with defects in meiosis and analyze the effects of a changing environment on meiosis.},

This rate depends on the population recombination rate,               C               . An estimate of               C               for humans is usually obtained from a comparison of physical and genetic maps, assuming an effective population size of approximately 10               4               . We demonstrate that under both a constant population size model and a model of long-term exponential growth, there is evidence for more recombination in polymorphism data than is expected from this estimate. An important contribution of gene conversion to meiotic recombination helps to explain our observation, but does not appear to be sufficient. The occurrence of multiple hits at CpG sites and the presence of population structure are not explanations.},

  abstract = {Background: Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., syn. Cenchrus americanus (L.) R. Br) is an important cereal and fodder crop in hot and arid environments. There is great potential to improve pearl millet production through hybrid breeding. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and the corresponding nuclear fertility restoration / sterility maintenance genes (Rfs) are essential tools for economic hybrid seed production in pearl millet. Mapping the Rf genes of the A4 CMS system in pearl millet would enable more efficient introgression of both dominant malefertility restoration alleles (Rf) and their recessive male-sterility maintenance counterparts (rf). Results: A high density linkage map based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was generated using an F2 mapping population and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The parents of this cross were `ICMA 02777' and `ICMR 08888', which segregate for the A4 Rf locus. The linkage map consists of 460 SNP markers distributed mostly evenly and has a total length of 462 cM. The segregation ratio of male-fertile and male-sterile plants (3:1) based on pollen production (presence/absence) indicated monogenic dominant inheritance of male-fertility restoration. Correspondingly, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for pollen production was found on linkage group 2, with cross-validation showing a very high QTL occurrence (97\%). The major QTL was confirmed using selfed seed set as phenotypic trait, though with a lower precision. However, these QTL explained only 14.5\% and 9.9\% of the phenotypic variance of pollen production and selfed seed set, respectively, which was below expectation. Two functional KASP markers were developed for the identified locus. Conclusion: This study identified a major QTL for male-fertility restoration using a GBS-based linkage map and developed KASP markers which support high-throughput screening of the haploblock. This is a first step toward marker-assisted selection of A4 male-fertility restoration and male-sterility maintenance in pearl millet.},

  abstract = {Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br; also Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone] is an important crop throughout the world but better genomic resources for this species are needed to facilitate crop improvement. Genome mapping studies are a prerequisite for tagging agronomically important traits. Genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) markers can be used to build high-density linkage maps, even in species lacking a reference genome. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was developed from a cross between the lines `Tift 99D2B1' and `Tift 454'. DNA from 186 RILs, the parents, and the F1 was used for 96-plex ApeKI GBS library development, which was further used for sequencing. The sequencing results showed that the average number of good reads per individual was 2.2 million, the pass filter rate was 88\%, and the CV was 43\%. High-quality GBS markers were developed with stringent filtering on sequence data from 179 RILs. The reference genetic map developed using 150 RILs contained 16,650 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 333,567 sequence tags spread across all seven chromosomes. The overall average density of SNP markers was 23.23 SNP/cM in the final map and 1.66 unique linkage bins per cM covering a total genetic distance of 716.7 cM. The linkage map was further validated for its utility by using it in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for flowering time and resistance to Pyricularia leaf spot [Pyricularia grisea (Cke.) Sacc.]. This map is the densest yet reported for this crop and will be a valuable resource for the pearl millet community.},

  abstract = {Background: Cultivated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is one of the most widely cultivated types of leafy vegetable in the world, and it has a high nutritional value. Spinach is also an ideal plant for investigating the mechanism of sex determination because it is a dioecious species with separate male and female plants. Some reports on the sex labeling and localization of spinach in the study of molecular markers have surfaced. However, there have only been two reports completed on the genetic map of spinach. The lack of rich and reliable molecular markers and the shortage of high-density linkage maps are important constraints in spinach research work. In this study, a high-density genetic map of spinach based on the Specific-locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq) technique was constructed; the sex-determining gene was also finely mapped. Results: Through bio-information analysis, 50.75 Gb of data in total was obtained, including 207.58 million paired-end reads. Finally, 145,456 high-quality SLAF markers were obtained, with 27,800 polymorphic markers and 4080 SLAF markers were finally mapped onto the genetic map after linkage analysis. The map spanned 1,125.97 cM with an average distance of 0.31 cM between the adjacent marker loci. It was divided into 6 linkage groups corresponding to the number of spinach chromosomes. Besides, the combination of Bulked Segregation Analysis (BSA) with SLAF-seq technology(super-BSA) was employed to generate the linkage markers with the sex-determining gene. Combined with the high-density genetic map of spinach, the sex-determining gene X/Y was located at the position of the linkage group (LG) 4 (66.98 cM{\textendash}69.72 cM and 75.48 cM{\textendash}92.96 cM), which may be the ideal region for the sex-determining gene. Conclusions: A high-density genetic map of spinach based on the SLAF-seq technique was constructed with a backcross (BC1) population (which is the highest density genetic map of spinach reported at present). At the same time, the sex-determining gene X/Y was mapped to LG4 with super-BSA. This map will offer a suitable basis for further study of spinach, such as gene mapping, map-based cloning of Specific genes, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS). It will also provide an efficient reference for studies on the mechanism of sex determination in other dioecious plants.},

Ellipsoidal nodules, 140 {\texttimes} 120 nm in diameter, were associated with the central space of synaptonemal complexes. The average number of nodules per pachytene oocyte was 57.5. The number of nodules per bivalent showed a clear linear relationship with SC length, except for the microchromosomes, which showed a single obligatory nodule. The distribution of nodules along the 10 longest SCs was nonrandom, with low frequencies in the vicinity of kinetochores and high frequencies near the telomeres. The microchromosomes showed a single nodule whose average location was 1.21 \emph{{\textmu}}m from the kinetochore. In the ZW pair there was a single nodule whose average location was 0.31 \emph{{\textmu}}m from the paired telomeres and not more than 0.65 \emph{{\textmu}}m from them. The total number of nodules per cell and the number of nodules in each of the five major bivalents showed good agreement with the total number of chiasmata and the number of chiasmata of the major bivalents of roosters. Thus, these nodules share the characteristics of recombination nodules described in other organisms. The single, obligatory, strictly localized recombination nodule found in the pairing end of the ZW pair strongly suggests that recombination between the Z and W chromosomes in the female chicken is a regular process that may be similar to the obligatory recombination between the pairing ends of the human X and Y chromosomes that was recently described in studies using DNA probes.},

  abstract = {Background: Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is a widely cultivated drought- and high-temperature tolerant C4 cereal grown under dryland, rainfed and irrigated conditions in drought-prone regions of the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa, South Asia and the Americas. It is considered an orphan crop with relatively few genomic and genetic resources. This study was undertaken to increase the EST-based microsatellite marker and genetic resources for this crop to facilitate marker-assisted breeding. Results: Newly developed EST-SSR markers (99), along with previously mapped EST-SSR (17), genomic SSR (53) and STS (2) markers, were used to construct linkage maps of four F7 recombinant inbred populations (RIP) based on crosses ICMB 841-P3 {\texttimes} 863B-P2 (RIP A), H 77/833-2 {\texttimes} PRLT 2/89-33 (RIP B), 81B-P6 {\texttimes} ICMP 451-P8 (RIP C) and PT 732B-P2 {\texttimes} P1449-2-P1 (RIP D). Mapped loci numbers were greatest for RIP A (104), followed by RIP B (78), RIP C (64) and RIP D (59). Total map lengths (Haldane) were 615 cM, 690 cM, 428 cM and 276 cM, respectively. A total of 176 loci detected by 171 primer pairs were mapped among the four crosses. A consensus map of 174 loci (899 cM) detected by 169 primer pairs was constructed using MergeMap to integrate the individual linkage maps. Locus order in the consensus map was well conserved for nearly all linkage groups. Eighty-nine EST-SSR marker loci from this consensus map had significant BLAST hits (top hits with e-value {$\leq$} 1E-10) on the genome sequences of rice, foxtail millet, sorghum, maize and Brachypodium with 35, 88, 58, 48 and 38 loci, respectively. Conclusion: The consensus map developed in the present study contains the largest set of mapped SSRs reported to date for pearl millet, and represents a major consolidation of existing pearl millet genetic mapping information. This study increased numbers of mapped pearl millet SSR markers by {$>$}50\%, filling important gaps in previously published SSR-based linkage maps for this species and will greatly facilitate SSR-based QTL mapping and applied marker-assisted selection programs.},

  abstract = {High-density linkage maps are important tools for genome biology and evolutionary genetics by quantifying the extent of recombination, linkage disequilibrium, and chromosomal rearrangements across chromosomes, sexes, and populations. They provide one of the best ways to validate and refine de novo genome assemblies, with the power to identify errors in assemblies increasing with marker density. However, assembly of high-density linkage maps is still challenging due to software limitations. We describe LepMAP2, a software for ultradense genome-wide linkage map construction. Lep-MAP2 can handle various family structures and can account for achiasmatic meiosis to gain linkage map accuracy. Simulations show that Lep-MAP2 outperforms other available mapping software both in computational efficiency and accuracy. When applied to two large F2-generation recombinant crosses between two nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations, it produced two high-density ({\textasciitilde}6 markers/cM) linkage maps containing 18,691 and 20,054 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The two maps showed a high degree of synteny, but female maps were 1.5{\textendash}2 times longer than male maps in all linkage groups, suggesting genome-wide recombination suppression in males. Comparison with the genome sequence of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) revealed a high degree of interspecific synteny with a low frequency ({$<$}5\%) of interchromosomal rearrangements. However, a fairly large (ca. 10 Mb) translocation from autosome to sex chromosome was detected in both maps. These results illustrate the utility and novel features of Lep-MAP2 in assembling highdensity linkage maps, and their usefulness in revealing evolutionarily interesting properties of genomes, such as strong genome-wide sex bias in recombination rates.},

  abstract = {The identification of loci influenced by positive selection is a major goal of evolutionary genetics. A popular approach is to perform scans of alignments on a genome-wide scale in order to find regions evolving at accelerated rates on a particular branch of a phylogenetic tree. However, positive selection is not the only process that can lead to accelerated evolution. Notably, GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process that results in the biased fixation of G and C nucleotides. This process can potentially generate bursts of nucleotide substitutions within hotspots of meiotic recombination. Here, we analyse the results of a scan for positive selection on genes on branches across the primate phylogeny. We show that genes identified as targets of positive selection have a significant tendency to exhibit the genomic signature of gBGC. Using a maximum-likelihood framework, we estimate that more than 20 per cent of cases of significantly elevated non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates ratio (               d               N               /               d               S               ), particularly in shorter branches, could be due to gBGC. We demonstrate that in some cases, gBGC can lead to very high               d               N               /               d               S               (more than 2). Our results indicate that gBGC significantly affects the evolution of coding sequences in primates, often leading to patterns of evolution that can be mistaken for positive selection.},

In fact, these error-prone polymerases are sometimes used in circumstances where the capacity to make errors has a selective advantage.

Collinearity between the map and the genome-wide reference sequence for watermelon was studied to identify inconsistency and chromosome rearrangements. We assessed genome-wide nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and selective sweep for wild, semi-wild, and domesticated accessions of Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus to track signals of domestication. Principal component analysis combined with chromosome-wide phylogenetic study based on 1563 SNPs obtained after LD pruning with minor allele frequency of 0.05 resolved the differences between semi-wild and wild accessions as well as relationships among worldwide sweet watermelon. Population structure analysis revealed predominant ancestries for wild, semi-wild, and domesticated watermelons as well as admixture of various ancestries that were important for domestication. Sliding window analysis of Tajima's D across various chromosomes was used to resolve selective sweep. LD decay was estimated for various chromosomes. We identified a strong selective sweep on chromosome 3 consisting of important genes that might have had a role in sweet watermelon domestication.},

  abstract = {Understanding local adaptation has become a key research area given the ongoing climate challenge and the concomitant requirement to conserve genetic resources. Perennial plants, such as forest trees, are good models to study local adaptation given their wide geographic distribution, largely outcrossing mating systems, and demographic histories. We evaluated signatures of local adaptation in European aspen (Populus tremula) across Europe by means of whole-genome resequencing of a collection of 411 individual trees. We dissected admixture patterns between aspen lineages and observed a strong genomic mosaicism in Scandinavian trees, evidencing different colonization trajectories into the peninsula from Russia, Central and Western Europe. As a consequence of the secondary contacts between populations after the last glacial maximum, we detected an adaptive introgression event in a genome region of \$500 kb in chromosome 10, harboring a large-effect locus that has previously been shown to contribute to adaptation to the short growing seasons characteristic of Northern Scandinavia. Demographic simulations and ancestry inference suggest an Eastern origin{\textemdash}probably Russian{\textemdash}of the adaptive Nordic allele which nowadays is present in a homozygous state at the north of Scandinavia. The strength of introgression and positive selection signatures in this region is a unique feature in the genome. Furthermore, we detected signals of balancing selection, shared across regional populations, that highlight the importance of standing variation as a primary source of alleles that facilitate local adaptation. Our results, therefore, emphasize the importance of migration{\textendash}selection balance underlying the genetic architecture of key adaptive quantitative traits.},

In coding regions, G + C-poor species tend to have unimodal distributions of G + C content among genes within genomes and slight 50{\textendash}30 gradients along genes. In contrast, G + C-rich species display bimodal distributions of G + C content among genes and steep 50{\textendash}30 decreasing gradients along genes. The causes of these peculiar patterns are still poorly understood. Within two species (Arabidopsis thaliana and rice), each representative of one side of the continuum, we studied the consequences of intron presence on coding region and intron G + C content at different scales. By properly taking intron structure into account, we showed that, in both species, intron presence is associated with step changes in nucleotide, codon, and amino acid composition. This suggests that introns have a barrier effect structuring G + C content along genes and that previous continuous characterizations of the 50{\textendash}30 gradients were artifactual. In external gene regions (located upstream first or downstream last introns), species-specific factors, such as GC-biased gene conversion, are shaping G + C content whereas in internal gene regions (surrounded by introns), G + C content is likely constrained to remain within a range common to both species.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing awareness that selection affecting linked neutral sites strongly influences on how diversity is distributed across the genome. In particular, linked selection is likely involved in the formation of heterogenous landscapes of genetic diversity, including genomic regions with locally reduced effective population sizes that manifest as dips in diversity, and ``islands'' of differentiation between closely related populations or species. Linked selection can be in the form of background selection or selective sweeps, and a long-standing quest in population genetics has been to unveil the relative importance of these processes. Here, we analyzed the theoretically expected reduction of diversity caused by linked selection in the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) genome and compared this with population genomic data on the distribution of diversity across the flycatcher genome. By incorporating data on recombination rate variation and the density of target sites for selection (including both protein-coding genes and conserved noncoding elements), we found that background selection can explain most of the observed baseline variation in genetic diversity. However, positive selection was necessary to explain the pronounced local diversity dips in the collared flycatcher genome. We confirmed our analytical findings by comprehensive simulations. Therefore, our study demonstrates that even though both background selection and selective sweeps contribute to the heterogeneous diversity landscape seen in this avian system, they play different roles in shaping it.},

  abstract = {Classical models suggest that recombination rates on sex chromosomes evolve in a stepwise manner to localize sexually antagonistic variants in the sex in which they are beneficial, thereby lowering rates of recombination between X and Y chromosomes. However, it is also possible that sex chromosome formation occurs in regions with preexisting recombination suppression. To evaluate these possibilities, we constructed linkage maps and a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the dioecious plant Rumex hastatulus. This species has a polymorphic karyotype with a young neo-sex chromosome, resulting from a Robertsonian fusion between the X chromosome and an autosome, in part of its geographic range. We identified the shared and neo-sex chromosomes using comparative genetic maps of the two cytotypes. We found that sex-linked regions of both the ancestral and the neo-sex chromosomes are embedded in large regions of low recombination. Furthermore, our comparison of the recombination landscape of the neo-sex chromosome to its autosomal homolog indicates that low recombination rates mainly preceded sex linkage. These patterns are not unique to the sex chromosomes; all chromosomes were characterized by massive regions of suppressed recombination spanning most of each chromosome. This represents an extreme case of the periphery-biased recombination seen in other systems with large chromosomes. Across all chromosomes, gene and repetitive sequence density correlated with recombination rate, with patterns of variation differing by repetitive element type. Our findings suggest that ancestrally low rates of recombination may facilitate the formation and subsequent evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Recombination rate and linkage disequilibrium, the latter a function of population genomic processes, are the critical parameters for mapping by linkage and association, and their patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans are poorly understood. We performed high-density SNP genotyping on a large panel of recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) of C. elegans to characterize the landscape of recombination and, on a panel of wild strains, to characterize population genomic patterns. We confirmed that C. elegans autosomes exhibit discrete domains of nearly constant recombination rate, and we show, for the first time, that the pattern holds for the X chromosome as well. The terminal domains of each chromosome, spanning about 7\% of the genome, exhibit effectively no recombination. The RIAILs exhibit a 5.3-fold expansion of the genetic map. With median marker spacing of 61 kb, they are a powerful resource for mapping quantitative trait loci in C. elegans. Among 125 wild isolates, we identified only 41 distinct haplotypes. The patterns of genotypic similarity suggest that some presumed wild strains are laboratory contaminants. The Hawaiian strain, CB4856, exhibits genetic isolation from the remainder of the global population, whose members exhibit ample evidence of intercrossing and recombining. The population effective recombination rate, estimated from the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, is correlated with the estimated meiotic recombination rate, but its magnitude implies that the effective rate of outcrossing is extremely low, corroborating reports of selection against recombinant genotypes. Despite the low population, effective recombination rate and extensive linkage disequilibrium among chromosomes, which are techniques that account for background levels of genomic similarity, permit association mapping in wild C. elegans strains.},

  abstract = {Recombination rate and linkage disequilibrium, the latter a function of population genomic processes, are the critical parameters for mapping by linkage and association, and their patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans are poorly understood. We performed high-density SNP genotyping on a large panel of recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) of C. elegans to characterize the landscape of recombination and, on a panel of wild strains, to characterize population genomic patterns. We confirmed that C. elegans autosomes exhibit discrete domains of nearly constant recombination rate, and we show, for the first time, that the pattern holds for the X chromosome as well. The terminal domains of each chromosome, spanning about 7\% of the genome, exhibit effectively no recombination. The RIAILs exhibit a 5.3-fold expansion of the genetic map. With median marker spacing of 61 kb, they are a powerful resource for mapping quantitative trait loci in C. elegans. Among 125 wild isolates, we identified only 41 distinct haplotypes. The patterns of genotypic similarity suggest that some presumed wild strains are laboratory contaminants. The Hawaiian strain, CB4856, exhibits genetic isolation from the remainder of the global population, whose members exhibit ample evidence of intercrossing and recombining. The population effective recombination rate, estimated from the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, is correlated with the estimated meiotic recombination rate, but its magnitude implies that the effective rate of outcrossing is extremely low, corroborating reports of selection against recombinant genotypes. Despite the low population, effective recombination rate and extensive linkage disequilibrium among chromosomes, which are techniques that account for background levels of genomic similarity, permit association mapping in wild C. elegans strains.},

  abstract = {Significance             Meiotic recombination is known to vary over 1,000-fold in many eukaryotic organisms, including maize. This regional genomic variation has enormous consequences for plant breeders, who rely on meiotic cross-overs to fine-map quantitative traits and introgress favorable alleles. Deleterious mutations are also predicted to accumulate preferentially within low-recombination regions, particularly within historically outcrossing species, such as maize. Here, we show that meiotic recombination is predictable across diverse crosses based on several genomic features of the reference genome. We demonstrate that the extant patterns of recombination are historically stable and tied to variation in the number of deleterious mutations. The ability of plant breeders to exploit recombination to purge segregating deleterious alleles will determine the efficacy of future crop improvement.           ,              Among the fundamental evolutionary forces, recombination arguably has the largest impact on the practical work of plant breeders.

  abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a polymer that spans {\textasciitilde}100 nm between paired homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Its striated, periodic appearance in electron micrographs led to the idea that transverse filaments within this structure `crosslink' the axes of homologous chromosomes, stabilizing their pairing. SC proteins can also form polycomplexes, three-dimensional lattices that recapitulate the periodic structure of SCs but do not associate with chromosomes. Here we provide evidence that SCs and polycomplexes contain mobile subunits and that their assembly is promoted by weak hydrophobic interactions, indicative of a liquid crystalline phase. We further show that in the absence of recombination intermediates, polycomplexes recapitulate the dynamic localization of pro-crossover factors during meiotic progression, revealing how the SC might act as a conduit to regulate chromosome-wide crossover distribution. Properties unique to liquid crystals likely enable long-range signal transduction along meiotic chromosomes and underlie the rapid evolution of SC proteins.           ,              The genetic information in cells is encoded within long molecules of DNA called chromosomes. In most human cells, the two copies of each chromosome {\textendash} the one inherited from our mother and the one from our father {\textendash} are physically separated and behave independently. However, in the reproductive cells that give rise to eggs or sperm, each chromosome must pair with its partner. Pairing first occurs at one or more positions along each chromosome. This triggers a protein-based polymer called the ``synaptonemal complex'' to assemble between the paired chromosomes, and then spread along the interface between the partners until they are fully lined up side-by-side. Chromosomes in reproductive cells must pair in this particular way to exchange genetic information and generate new combinations of traits.             The synaptonemal complex was first observed over 60 years ago, but it remains enigmatic. Though its structure is highly ordered and looks very similar in different organisms from yeast to humans, little is known about how this polymer forms or what it does between chromosomes. Some evidence has suggested that the synaptonemal complex helps to regulate how much information can be transferred between each pair of chromosomes, but not all studies have supported this conclusion.             Several lines of evidence suggest that the synaptonemal complex might be fundamentally different from other protein-based polymers, such as those that form filamentous skeletal structures within cells, namely actin filaments and microtubules. Now, Rog et al. have tested the idea that the synaptonemal complex might actually have liquid-like properties, despite its highly ordered appearance.             The experiments showed that the proteins that make up the synaptonemal complex in yeast, worms and fruit flies are weakly bound to each other and can move around within the assembled structure. These are considered to be defining properties that distinguish liquids from solid materials. Together with its regular, repetitive organization, these findings indicate that the synaptonemal complex behaves like a liquid crystal. This intriguing class of materials has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals, and is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions.             Rog et al. believe that this discovery helps to explain how signals are transmitted along the length of chromosomes to regulate the transfer of genetic information. In support of this idea, further experiments showed that proteins that are required for this recombination process were also found within the synaptonemal complex. As reproductive cells transition from one stage of their development to the next, these proteins abruptly move to a new location, indicating that a switch-like signal rapidly spreads throughout the synaptonemal complex.             Together the findings suggest that the liquid crystal-like properties of the synaptonemal complex allow signals to be transmitted along the interface between pairs of chromosomes. The next challenges are to understand what triggers these signals and to explore whether they are based upon physical or chemical changes within the synaptonemal complex. Further research is also needed to uncover how this information is propagated along the length of a chromosome.},

The maps include, respectively, 2584 loci at 1.72-cM (ŸÅ600 kb) intervals based on 2007 probes (AtDt) and 763 loci at 1.96-cM (ŸÅ500 kb) intervals detected by 662 probes (D). Both diploid and tetraploid cottons exhibit negative crossover interference; i.e., double recombinants are unexpectedly abundant. We found no major structural changes between Dt and D chromosomes, but confirmed two reciprocal translocations between At chromosomes and several inversions. Concentrations of probes in corresponding regions of the various genomes may represent centromeres, while genome-specific concentrations may represent heterochromatin. Locus duplication patterns reveal all 13 expected homeologous chromosome sets and lend new support to the possibility that a more ancient polyploidization event may have predated the A-D divergence of 6{\textendash}11 million years ago. Identification of SSRs within 312 RFLP sequences plus direct mapping of 124 SSRs and exploration for CAPS and SNPs illustrate the ``portability'' of these STS loci across populations and detection systems useful for marker-assisted improvement of the world's leading fiber crop.

We consider a spectrum of situations with intrachromosomal heterogeneity of recombination rate, different level of genotyping errors, and missing data. In the ideal scenario of the absence of errors and missing data, the majority of markers should appear as groups of cosegregating markers (``twins'') representing no challenge for map construction. The central aspect of the proposed approach is to take into account the structure of the marker space, where each twin group (TG) and singleton markers are represented as points of this space. The confounding effect of genotyping errors and missing data leads to reduction of TG size, but upon a low level of these effects surviving TGs can still be used as a source of reliable skeletal markers. Increase in the level of confounding effects results in a considerable decrease in the number or even disappearance of usable TGs and, correspondingly, of skeletal markers. Here, we show that the paucity of informative markers can be compensated by detecting kernels of markers in the marker space using a clustering procedure, and demonstrate the utility of this approach for high-density genetic map construction on simulated and experimentally obtained genotyping datasets.},

The taxa investigated comprise two self-compatible (SC) and three self-incompatible (SI) species. The observed reduction in nucleotide diversity in the SC populations compared to the SI populations is much stronger than expected under the neutral effects of the mating system on effective population size. Importantly, outgroup sequences available for 11 of the 14 loci yield strong positive correlations between silent nucleotide diversity and silent divergence, indicative of marked among-locus differences in mutation rates and/or selective constraints. Furthermore, using a physical estimate of local recombination rates, we find that silent nucleotide diversity (but not divergence) is positively correlated with recombination rate in two of the SI species. However, this correlation is not nearly as strong as in other well-characterized species (in particular, Drosophila). We propose that nucleotide diversity in Lycopersicon is dominated mainly by differences in neutral mutation rates and/or selective constraints among loci, demographic processes (such as population subdivision), and background selection. In addition, we hypothesize that the soil seed bank plays an important role in the maintenance of the large genetic diversity in the SI species (in particular L. peruvianum).},

  abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is essential for reproductive success. Yet, many fundamental aspects of meiosis remain unclear, including the mechanisms regulating homolog pairing across species. This gap is partially due to our inability to visualize individual chromosomes during meiosis. Here, we employ Oligopaint FISH to investigate homolog pairing and compaction of meiotic chromosomes and resurrect a classical model system, the silkworm               Bombyx mori               . Our Oligopaint design combines multiplexed barcoding with secondary oligo labeling for high flexibility and low cost. These studies illustrate that Oligopaints are highly specific in whole-mount gonads and on meiotic squashes. We show that meiotic pairing is robust in both males and females and that pairing can occur through numerous partially paired intermediate structures. We also show that pairing in male meiosis occurs asynchronously and seemingly in a transcription-biased manner. Further, we reveal that meiotic bivalent formation in               B               .               mori               males is highly similar to bivalent formation in               C               .               elegans               , with both of these pathways ultimately resulting in the pairing of chromosome ends with non-paired ends facing the spindle pole. Additionally, microtubule recruitment in both               C               .               elegans               and               B               .               mori               is likely dependent on kinetochore proteins but independent of the centromere-specifying histone CENP-A. Finally, using super-resolution microscopy in the female germline, we show that homologous chromosomes remain associated at telomere domains in the absence of chiasma and after breakdown and modification to the synaptonemal complex in pachytene.

  abstract = {The successful domestication of wild plants has been one of the most important human accomplishments of the last 10,000 yr. Though our empirical knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of plant domestication is still relatively limited, there exists a large body of theory that offers a host of hypotheses on the genetics of domestication. Two of these that have not been addressed concern the role of recombination in the process of domestication. The first predicts an increase in recombination rate through domestication, while the second argues that recombination rate should serve as a preadaptation to domestication. This study makes use of data on chiasma frequencies available from almost a century of plant cytogenetical literature to test these two hypotheses. The results support the hypothesis that domestication selects for an increase in recombination, and in rejecting the preadaptation hypothesis, they suggest directions for future research into the possibility of preadaptation to domestication.},

  abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae is an emerging model organism that allows evolutionary comparisons with C. elegans and exploration of its own unique biological attributes. To produce a high-resolution C. briggsae recombination map, recombinant inbred lines were generated from reciprocal crosses between two strains and genotyped at over 1,000 loci. A second set of recombinant inbred lines involving a third strain was also genotyped at lower resolution. The resulting recombination maps exhibit discrete domains of high and low recombination, as in C. elegans, indicating these are a general feature of Caenorhabditis species. The proportion of a chromosome's physical size occupied by the central, lowrecombination domain is highly correlated between species. However, the C. briggsae intra-species comparison reveals striking variation in the distribution of recombination between domains. Hybrid lines made with the more divergent pair of strains also exhibit pervasive marker transmission ratio distortion, evidence of selection acting on hybrid genotypes. The strongest effect, on chromosome III, is explained by a developmental delay phenotype exhibited by some hybrid F2 animals. In addition, on chromosomes IV and V, cross direction-specific biases towards one parental genotype suggest the existence of cytonuclear epistatic interactions. These interactions are discussed in relation to surprising mitochondrial genome polymorphism in C. briggsae, evidence that the two strains diverged in allopatry, the potential for local adaptation, and the evolution of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. The genetic and genomic resources resulting from this work will support future efforts to understand inter-strain divergence as well as facilitate studies of gene function, natural variation, and the evolution of recombination in Caenorhabditis nematodes.},

  abstract = {Recombination is expected to affect functional sequence evolution in several ways. On the one hand, recombination is thought to improve the efficiency of multilocus selection by dissipating linkage disequilibrium. On the other hand, natural selection can be counteracted by recombination-associated transmission distorters such as GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), which tends to promote G and C alleles irrespective of their fitness effect in high-recombining regions. It has been suggested that gBGC might impact coding sequence evolution in vertebrates, and particularly the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS). However, distinctive gBGC patterns have been reported in mammals and birds, maybe reflecting the documented contrasts in evolutionary dynamics of recombination rate between these two taxa. Here, we explore how recombination and gBGC affect coding sequence evolution in mammals and birds by analyzing proteome-wide data in six species of Galloanserae (fowls) and six species of catarrhine primates. We estimated the dN/dS ratio and rates of adaptive and nonadaptive evolution in bins of genes of increasing recombination rate, separately analyzing AT ! GC, GC ! AT, and G \$ C/A \$ T mutations. We show that in both taxa, recombination and gBGC entail a decrease in dN/dS. Our analysis indicates that recombination enhances the efficiency of purifying selection by lowering Hill{\textendash}Robertson effects, whereas gBGC leads to an overestimation of the adaptive rate of AT ! GC mutations. Finally, we report a mutagenic effect of recombination, which is independent of gBGC.},

  abstract = {The reshuffling of existing genetic variation during meiosis is important both during evolution and in breeding. The reassortment of genetic variants relies on the formation of crossovers (COs) between homologous chromosomes. The pattern of genome-wide CO distributions can be rapidly and precisely established by the short-read sequencing of individuals from F2 populations, which in turn are useful for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Although sequencing costs have decreased precipitously in recent years, the costs of library preparation for hundreds of individuals have remained high. To enable rapid and inexpensive CO detection and QTL mapping using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of large mapping populations, we have developed a new method for library preparation along with Trained Individual GenomE Reconstruction, a probabilistic method for genotype and CO predictions for recombinant individuals. In an example case with hundreds of F2 individuals from two Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, we resolved most CO breakpoints to within 2 kb and reduced a major flowering time QTL to a 9-kb interval. In addition, an extended region of unusually low recombination revealed a 1.8-Mb inversion polymorphism on the long arm of chromosome 4. We observed no significant differences in the frequency and distribution of COs between F2 individuals with and without a functional copy of the DNA helicase gene RECQ4A. In summary, we present a new, cost-efficient method for large-scale, high-precision genotyping-by-sequencing.},

  abstract = {Background: Witches' broom disease (WBD) caused by the fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa is responsible for considerable economic losses for cacao producers. One of the ways to combat WBD is to plant resistant cultivars. Resistance may be governed by a few genetic factors, mainly found in wild germplasm. Results: We developed a dense genetic linkage map with a length of 852.8 cM that contains 3,526 SNPs and is based on the MP01 mapping population, which counts 459 trees from a cross between the resistant `TSH 1188' and the tolerant `CCN 51' at the Mars Center for Cocoa Science in Barro Preto, Bahia, Brazil. Seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are associated with WBD were identified on five different chromosomes using a multi-trait QTL analysis for outbreeders. Phasing of the haplotypes at the major QTL region on chromosome IX on a diversity panel of genotypes clearly indicates that the major resistance locus comes from a well-known source of WBD resistance, the clone `SCAVINA 6'. Various potential candidate genes identified within all QTL may be involved in different steps leading to disease resistance. Preliminary expression data indicate that at least three of these candidate genes may play a role during the first 12 h after infection, with clear differences between `CCN 51' and `TSH 1188'. Conclusions: We combined the information from a large mapping population with very distinct parents that segregate for WBD, a dense set of mapped markers, rigorous phenotyping capabilities and the availability of a sequenced genome to identify several genomic regions that are involved in WBD resistance. We also identified a novel source of resistance that most likely comes from the `CCN 51' parent. Thanks to the large population size of the MP01 population, we were able to pick up QTL and markers with relatively small effects that can contribute to the creation and selection of more tolerant/resistant plant material.},

  abstract = {In finite populations, genetic drift generates interference between selected loci, causing advantageous alleles to be found more often on different chromosomes than on the same chromosome, which reduces the rate of adaptation. This ``Hill{\textendash}Robertson effect'' generates indirect selection to increase recombination rates. We present a new method to quantify the strength of this selection. Our model represents a new beneficial allele (A) entering a population as a single copy, while another beneficial allele (B) is sweeping at another locus. A third locus affects the recombination rate between selected loci. Using a branching process model, we calculate the probability distribution of the number of copies of A on the different genetic backgrounds, after it is established but while it is still rare. Then, we use a deterministic model to express the change in frequency of the recombination modifier, due to hitchhiking, as A goes to fixation. We show that this method can give good estimates of selection for recombination. Moreover, it shows that recombination is selected through two different effects: it increases the fixation probability of new alleles, and it accelerates selective sweeps. The relative importance of these two effects depends on the relative times of occurrence of the beneficial alleles.},

  abstract = {One of the most widely cited hypotheses to explain the evolutionary maintenance of genetic recombination states that the reshuffling of genotypes at meiosis increases the efficiency of natural selection by reducing interference among selected loci. However, and despite several decades of theoretical work, a quantitative estimation of the possible selective advantage of a mutant allele increasing chromosomal map length (the average number of cross-overs at meiosis) remains difficult. This article derives a simple expression for the strength of selection acting on a modifier gene affecting the genetic map length of a whole chromosome or genome undergoing recurrent mutation. In particular, it shows that indirect selection for recombination caused by interference among mutations is proportional to                                                                                                                                                                                                               N                                                                                         e                                                                                   U                                                                                                                 2                                                           /                                                                                                                                                                               N                                                                                         e                                                                                   R                                                                                                                 3                                                                                       , where                                                                                               N                                                                 e                                                                                       is the effective population size, U is the deleterious mutation rate per chromosome, and R is the chromosome map length.

Mapping data for almost 3,000 genes showed that the gene space spans the whole chromosome 3B with a 2-fold increase of gene density toward the telomeres due to an increase in the number of genes in islands. Comparative analyses with rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium ~distachyon revealed that these gene islands are composed mainly of genes likely originating from interchromosomal gene duplications. Gene Ontology and expression profile analyses for the 3,000 genes located along the chromosome revealed that the gene islands are enriched significantly in genes sharing the same function or expression profile, thereby suggesting that genes in islands acquired shared regulation during evolution. Only a small fraction of these clusters of cofunctional and coexpressed genes was conserved with rice and B. distachyon, indicating a recent origin. Finally, genes with the same expression profiles in remote islands (coregulation islands) were identified suggesting long-distance regulation of gene expression along the chromosomes in wheat.},

These microelectrodes can be implanted individually or in the form of arrays containing dozens to hundreds of channels. Recordings of some channels contain neural activity, which are often contaminated with noise. Another fraction of channels does not record any neural data, but only noise. By noise, we mean physiological activities unrelated to spiking, including technical artifacts and neural activities of neurons that are too far away from the electrode to be usefully processed. For further analysis, an automatic identification and continuous tracking of channels containing neural data is of great significance for many applications, e.g. automated selection of neural channels during online and offline spike sorting. Automated spike detection and sorting is also critical for online decoding in brain{\textendash}computer interface (BCI) applications, in which only simple threshold crossing events are often considered for feature extraction. To our knowledge, there is no method that can universally and automatically identify channels containing neural data. In this study, we aim to identify and track channels containing neural data from implanted electrodes, automatically and more importantly universally. By universally, we mean across different recording technologies, different subjects and different brain areas.               Approach               . We propose a novel algorithm based on a new way of feature vector extraction and a deep learning method, which we call SpikeDeeptector. SpikeDeeptector considers a batch of waveforms to construct a single feature vector and enables contextual learning. The feature vectors are then fed to a deep learning method, which learns contextualized, temporal and spatial patterns, and classifies them as channels containing neural spike data or only noise.               Main results               . We trained the model of SpikeDeeptector on data recorded from a single tetraplegic patient with two Utah arrays implanted in different areas of the brain. The trained model was then evaluated on data collected from six epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes, unseen data from the tetraplegic patient and data from another tetraplegic patient implanted with two Utah arrays. The cumulative evaluation accuracy was 97.20\% on 1.56 million hand labeled test inputs.               Significance               . The results demonstrate that SpikeDeeptector generalizes not only to the new data, but also to different brain areas, subjects, and electrode types not used for training.               Clinical trial registration number               . The clinical trial registration number for patients implanted with the Utah array is               NCT 01849822               . For the epilepsy patients, approval from the local ethics committee at the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, was obtained prior to implantation.},

  abstract = {Crossing over, the exchange of DNA between the chromosomes during meiosis, contributes significantly to genetic variation. The rate of crossovers (CO) varies depending upon the taxon, population, age, external conditions, and also, sometimes, between the sexes, a phenomenon called heterochiasmy. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the male rate of all crossover events (mCO) is typically nearly double the female rate (fCO). A previous, PCR-based genotyping study has reported that the disparity decreases with increasing parental age, because fCO rises while mCO remains stable. We revisited this topic using a fluorescent tagged lines approach to examine how heterochiasmy responded to parental age in eight genomic intervals distributed across the organism's five chromosomes. We determined recombination frequency for, on average, more than 2000 seeds, for each interval, for each of four age groups, to estimate sex-specific CO rates. mCO did not change with age, as reported previously, but, here, fCO did not rise, and thus the levels of heterochiasmy were unchanged. We can see no methodological reason to doubt that our results reflect the underlying biology of the accessions we studied. The lack of response to age could perhaps be due to previously reported variation in CO rate among accessions of Arabidopsis.},

However, little is known about the factors affecting both the distribution and the intensity of recombination along this gradient. To investigate this, we studied in detail the pattern of CO along chromosome 3B of bread wheat. A dense reference genetic map comprising 102 markers homogeneously distributed along the chromosome was compared to a physical deletion map. Most of the COs (90\%) occurred in the distal subtelomeric regions that represent 40\% of the chromosome. About 27\% of the proximal regions surrounding the centromere showed a very weak CO frequency with only three COs found in the 752 gametes studied. Moreover, we observed a clear decrease of CO frequency on the distal region of the short arm. Finally, the intensity of interference was assessed for the first time in wheat using a Gamma model. The results showed m values of 1.2 for male recombination and 3.5 for female recombination, suggesting positive interference along wheat chromosome 3B.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of the rate of recombination are key to understanding a host of evolutionary processes as well as the evolution of recombination rate itself. Model-based population genetic methods that infer recombination rates from patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome have become a popular method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these LD-based methods make a variety of simplifying assumptions about the populations of interest that are often not met in natural populations. One such assumption is the absence of gene flow from other populations. Here, we use forward-time population genetic simulations of isolation-with-migration scenarios to explore how gene flow affects the accuracy of LD-based estimators of recombination rate. We find that moderate levels of gene flow can result in either the overestimation or underestimation of recombination rates by up to 20-50\% depending on the timing of divergence. We also find that these biases can affect the detection of interpopulation differences in recombination rate, causing both false positive and false negatives depending on the scenario. We discuss future possibilities for mitigating these biases and recommend that investigators exercise caution and confirm that their study populations meet assumptions before deploying these methods.},

  abstract = {Cultivated strawberry (Fragaria {\texttimes} ananassa) is a genetically complex allo-octoploid crop with 28 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 8x = 56) for which a genome sequence is not yet available. The diploid Fragaria vesca is considered the donor species of one of the octoploid subgenomes and its available genome sequence can be used as a reference for genomic studies. A wide number of strawberry cultivars are stored in ex situ germplasm collections worldwide but a number of previous studies have addressed the genetic diversity present within a limited number of these collections. Here, we report the development and application of two platforms based on the implementation of Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers for high-throughput genotyping in strawberry. The first DArT microarray was used to evaluate the genetic diversity of 62 strawberry cultivars that represent a wide range of variation based on phenotype, geographical and temporal origin and pedigrees. A total of 603 DArT markers were used to evaluate the diversity and structure of the population and their cluster analyses revealed that these markers were highly efficient in classifying the accessions in groups based on historical, geographical and pedigree-based cues. The second DArTseq platform took benefit of the complexity reduction method optimized for strawberry and the development of next generation sequencing technologies. The strawberry DArTseq was used to generate a total of 9,386 SNP markers in the previously developed `232' {\texttimes} `1392' mapping population, of which, 4,242 high quality markers were further selected to saturate this map after several filtering steps. The high-throughput platforms here developed for genotyping strawberry will facilitate genome-wide characterizations of large accessions sets and complement other available options.},

HR is also critical for the preservation of replication forks, for telomere maintenance, and chromosome segregation in meiosis I. As such, HR is indispensable for the maintenance of genome integrity and the avoidance of cancers in humans. The HR reaction is mediated by a conserved class of enzymes termed recombinases. Two recombinases, Rad51 and Dmc1, catalyze the pairing and shuffling of homologous DNA sequences in eukaryotic cells via a filamentous intermediate on ssDNA called the presynaptic filament. The assembly of the presynaptic filament is a rate-limiting process that is enhanced by recombination mediators, such as the breast tumor suppressor BRCA2. HR accessory factors that facilitate other stages of the Rad51- and Dmc1-catalyzed homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction have also been identified. Recent progress on elucidating the mechanisms of action of Rad51 and Dmc1 and their cohorts of ancillary factors is reviewed here.},

Gene 2 was in the same orientation in wheat and rice but inverted in barley. Gene density in this region was 1 gene per 43 kb and the ratio of physical to genetic distance was estimated to be 2,700 kb cM{\textendash}1. Twenty more-or-less intact retrotransposons were found in the intergenic regions, covering at least 70\% of the sequenced region. The insertion times of 11 retrotransposons were less than 5 million years ago and were consistent with their nested structure. Five new families of retroelements and the first full-length elements for two additional retrotransposon families were discovered in this region. Significantly higher values of GC content were observed for Triticeae BACs compared with rice BACs. Relative enrichment or depletion of certain dinucleotides was observed in the comparison of introns, exons and retrotransposons. A higher proportion of transitions in CG and CNG sites that are targets for cytosine methylation was observed in retrotransposons (76\%) than in introns (37\%). These results showed that the wheat genome is a complex mixture of different sequence elements, but with general patterns of content and interspersion that are similar to those seen in maize and barley.},

The analysis reveals landraces with unexplored diversity and genetic footprints defined by regions under selection.

  abstract = {Plants, like all sexually reproducing organisms, create genetic variability by reshuffling parental alleles during meiosis. Patterns of genetic variation in the resulting gametes are determined by the independent assortment of chromosomes in meiosis I and by the number and positioning of crossover (CO) events during meiotic recombination. On the chromosome level, spatial distribution of CO events is biased by multiple regulatory mechanisms, such as CO assurance, interference and homeostasis. However, little is known about how multiple COs are distributed among the four chromatids of a bivalent. Chromatid interference (CI) has been proposed as a regulatory mechanism that biases distribution of multiple COs toward specific chromatid partners, however, its existence has not been well-studied and its putative mechanistic basis remains undescribed. Here, we introduce a novel method to quantitatively express CI, and take advantage of available tetrad-based genotyping data from Arabidopsis and maize male meiosis to quantify CI effects on a genome-wide and chromosomal scale. Overall, our analyses reveal random involvement of sister chromatids in double CO events across paired chromosomes, indicating an absence of CI. However, on a genome-wide level, CI was found to vary with physical distance between COs, albeit with different effects in Arabidopsis and maize. While effects of CI are minor in Arabidopsis and maize, the novel methodology introduced here enables quantitative interpretation of CI both on a local and genome-wide scale, and thus provides a key tool to study CI with relevance for both plant genetics and crop breeding.},

  abstract = {Summary: QMSim was designed to simulate large-scale genotyping data in multiple and complex livestock pedigrees. The simulation is basically carried out in two steps. In the first step, a historical population is simulated to establish mutation-drift equilibrium, and in the second step, recent population structures are generated, which can be very complex. A wide variety of genome architectures, ranging from infinitesimal model to single-locus model, can be simulated. The program is efficient in terms of computing time and memory requirements.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination shapes the genetic diversity transmitted upon sexual reproduction. However, its non-random distribution along the chromosomes constrains the landscape of potential genetic combinations. For a variety of purposes, it is desirable to expand the natural repertoire by changing the distribution of crossovers in a wide range of eukaryotes. Toward this end, we report the local stimulation of meiotic recombination at a number of chromosomal sites by tethering the natural Spo11 protein to various DNA-binding modules: full-length DNA binding proteins, zinc fingers (ZFs), transcription activator-like effector (TALE) modules, and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, each strategy is able to stimulate crossover frequencies in naturally recombination-cold regions. The binding and cleavage efficiency of the targeting Spo11 fusions (TSF) are variable, being dependent on the chromosomal regions and potential competition with endogenous factors. TSF-mediated genome interrogation distinguishes naturally recombination-cold regions that are flexible and can be warmed-up (gene promoters and coding sequences), from those that remain refractory (gene terminators and centromeres). These results describe new generic experimental strategies to increase the genetic diversity of gametes, which should prove useful in plant breeding and other applications.},

  abstract = {The American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) is a recently domesticated, economically important, fruit crop with limited molecular resources. New genetic resources could accelerate genetic gain in cranberry through characterization of its genomic structure and by enabling molecular-assisted breeding strategies. To increase the availability of cranberry genomic resources, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to discover and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three interrelated cranberry full-sib populations. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were added to the SNP datasets and used to construct bin maps for the parents of the populations, which were then merged to create the first high-density cranberry composite map containing 6073 markers (5437 SNPs and 636 SSRs) on 12 linkage groups (LGs) spanning 1124 cM. Interestingly, higher rates of recombination were observed in maternal than paternal gametes. The large number of markers in common (mean of 57.3) and the high degree of observed collinearity (mean Pair-wise Spearman rank correlations .0.99) between the LGs of the parental maps demonstrates the utility of GBS in cranberry for identifying polymorphic SNP loci that are transferable between pedigrees and populations in future trait-association studies. Furthermore, the high-density of markers anchored within the component maps allowed identification of segregation distortion regions, placement of centromeres on each of the 12 LGs, and anchoring of genomic scaffolds. Collectively, the results represent an important contribution to the current understanding of cranberry genomic structure and to the availability of molecular tools for future genetic research and breeding efforts in cranberry.},

The determinants of somatic mutation accumulation include the intraorganismal selective effect of mutations, the number of cell divisions that separate the zygote from the formation of gametes, and shoot apical meristem structure and branching. Somatic mutations can promote the evolution of diploidy, polyploidy, sexual recombination, outcrossing, clonality, and separate sexes, and they may contribute genetic variability in many other traits. The amplification of beneficial mutations via intraorganismal selection may relax selection to reduce the genomic mutation rate or to protect the germline in plants. The total rate of somatic mutation, the distribution of selective effects and fates in the plant body, and the degree to which the germline is sheltered from somatic mutations are still poorly understood. Our knowledge can be improved through empirical estimates of mutation rates and effects on cell lineages and whole organisms, such as estimates of the reduction in fitness of progeny produced by within- versus between-flower crosses on the same plant, mutation coalescent studies within the canopy, and incorporation of somatic mutation into theoretical models of plant evolutionary genetics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The genomic landscape of recombination plays an essential role in evolution. Patterns of recombination are highly variable along chromosomes, between sexes, individuals, populations, and species. In many eukaryotes, recombination rates are elevated in sub-telomeric regions and drastically reduced near centromeres, resulting in large low-recombining (LR) regions. The processes of recombination are influenced by genetic factors, such as different alleles of genes involved in meiosis and chromatin structure, as well as external environmental stimuli like temperature and overall stress. In this work, we focused on the genomic landscapes of recombination in a collection of 916 rye (Secale cereale) individuals. By analysing population structure among individuals of different domestication status and geographic origin, we detected high levels of admixture, reflecting the reproductive biology of a self-incompatible, wind-pollinating grass species. We then analysed patterns of recombination in overlapping subpopulations, which revealed substantial variation in the physical size of LR regions, with a tendency for larger LR regions in domesticated subpopulations. Genome-wide association scans (GWAS) for LR region size revealed a major quantitative-trait-locus (QTL) at which, among 18 annotated genes, an ortholog of histone H4 acetyltransferase ESA1 was located. Rye individuals belonging to domesticated subpopulations showed increased synaptonemal complex length, but no difference in crossover frequency, indicating that only the recombination landscape is different. Furthermore, the genomic region harbouring rye ScESA1 showed moderate patterns of selection in domesticated subpopulations, suggesting that larger LR regions were indirectly selected for during domestication to achieve more homogeneous populations for agricultural use.},

Positive selection can result in hitchhiking (HH) events, in which a beneficial allele rapidly replaces all others in the population, creating a valley of diversity around the selected site along with characteristic skews in allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among linked neutral polymorphisms. Similarly, negative selection reduces variation not only at selected sites but also at linked sites{\textemdash}a phenomenon called background selection (BGS). Thus, discriminating between these two forces may be difficult, and one might expect efforts to detect HH to produce an excess of false positives in regions affected by BGS. Here, we examine the similarity between BGS and HH models via simulation. First, we show that BGS may somewhat resemble HH in simplistic scenarios in which a region constrained by negative selection is flanked by large stretches of unconstrained sites, echoing previous results. However, this scenario does not mirror the actual spatial arrangement of selected sites across the genome. By performing forward simulations under more realistic scenarios of BGS modeling the locations of protein-coding and conserved noncoding DNA in real genomes, we show that the spatial patterns of variation produced by BGS rarely mimic those left behind by HH events. Indeed, regions experiencing BGS are not substantially more likely than neutrally evolving regions to produce false signatures of HH. This holds for simulations modeled after both humans and             Drosophila             , and for several different demographic histories. These results demonstrate that HH and BGS models should be readily be separable in practice, and that appropriately designed scans for HH events need not consider background selection as an alternative model.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The availability of large-scale population genomic sequence data has resulted in an explosion in efforts to infer the demographic histories of natural populations across a broad range of organisms. As demographic events alter coalescent genealogies, they leave detectable signatures in patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been designed to leverage population genetic data to uncover the footprints of demographic change in the genome. The vast majority of these methods make the simplifying assumption that the measures of genetic variation used as their input are unaffected by natural selection. However, natural selection can dramatically skew patterns of variation not only at selected sites, but at linked, neutral loci as well. Here we assess the impact of recent positive selection on demographic inference by characterizing the performance of three popular methods through extensive simulation of data sets with varying numbers of linked selective sweeps. In particular, we examined three different demographic models relevant to a number of species, finding that positive selection can bias parameter estimates of each of these models{\textemdash}often severely. We find that selection can lead to incorrect inferences of population size changes when none have occurred. Moreover, we show that linked selection can lead to incorrect demographic model selection, when multiple demographic scenarios are compared. We argue that natural populations may experience the amount of recent positive selection required to skew inferences. These results suggest that demographic studies conducted in many species to date may have exaggerated the extent and frequency of population size changes.},

Tetrad analysis reveals decreasing gradients of gene conversion on both sides of the initiation site for meiotic recombination at the ARG4 locus, extending on one side into the ARG4 gene, and on the other side into the adjacent DED81 gene. Gene conversion events can extend in both directions from the initiation site as the result of a single meiotic event. There is a second gradient of gene conversion in DED81, with high levels near the 5' end of the gene and low levels near the middle of the gene. The peaks of gene conversion activity for the DED81 and ARG4 gradients map to regions where double-strand breaks are found during meiosis. The implications of these results for models of meiotic gene conversion are discussed.},

Non-functional orthologs of PRDM9 are present in a wide variety of vertebrates, but why it is functionally maintained in some lineages is not clear. One possible explanation is that PRDM9 plays a role in ensuring that meiosis is successful. During meiosis, available DNA may be a limiting resource given the tight packaging of chromosomes and could lead to competition between two key processes: meiotic transcription and recombination. Here we explore this potential competition and the role that PRDM9 might play in their interaction. Leveraging existing mouse genomic data, we use resampling schemes that simulate shuffled features along the genome and models that account for the rarity of features in the genome, to test if PRDM9 influences interactions between recombination hotspots and meiotic transcription in a whole genome framework. We also explored possible DNA sequence motifs associated to clusters of hotspots not tied to transcription or PRDM9. We find evidence of competition between meiotic transcription and recombination, with PRDM9 appearing to relocate recombination to avoid said conflict. We also find that retrotransposons may be playing a role in directing hotspots in the absence of other factors.},

Inversion polymorphisms represent a significant class of structural variant, and despite the challenges in their detection, data on inversions in the human genome are increasing rapidly. Statistical methods for inferring parameters such as the recombination rate and the selection coefficient have generally been developed without accounting for the presence of inversions. Here we exploit new software for simulating inversions in population genetic data, invertFREGENE, to assess the potential impact of inversions on such methods. Using data simulated by invertFREGENE, as well as real data from several sources, we test whether large inversions have a disruptive effect on widely applied population genetics methods for inferring recombination rates, for detecting selection, and for controlling for population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We find that recombination rates estimated by LDhat are biased downward at inversion loci relative to the true contemporary recombination rates at the loci but that recombination hotspots are not falsely inferred at inversion breakpoints as may have been expected. We find that the integrated haplotype score (iHS) method for detecting selection appears robust to the presence of inversions. Finally, we observe a strong bias in the genome-wide results of principal components analysis (PCA), used to control for population structure in GWAS, in the presence of even a single large inversion, confirming the necessity to thin SNPs by linkage disequilibrium at large physical distances to obtain unbiased results.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, centromeres in some species undergo a series of associations, but the processes and progression to homologous pairing is still a matter of debate. Here, we aimed to correlate meiotic centromere dynamics and early telomere behaviour to the progression of synaptonemal complex (SC) construction in hexaploid wheat (2n = 42) by triple immunolabelling of CENH3 protein marking functional centromeres, and SC proteins ASY1 (unpaired lateral elements) and ZYP1 (central elements in synapsed chromosomes). We show that single or multiple centromere associations formed in meiotic interphase undergo a progressive polarization (clustering) at the nuclear periphery in early leptotene, leading to formation of the telomere bouquet. Critically, immunolabelling shows the dynamics of these presynaptic centromere associations and a structural reorganization of the centromeric chromatin coinciding with key events of synapsis initiation from the subtelomeric regions. As short stretches of subtelomeric synapsis emerged at early zygotene, centromere clusters lost their strong polarization, gradually resolving as individual centromeres indicated by more than 21 CENH3 foci associated with unpaired lateral elements. Only following this centromere depolarization were homologous chromosome arms connected, as observed by the alignment and fusion of interstitial ZYP1 loci elongating at zygotene so synapsis at centromeres is a continuation of the interstitial synapsis. Our results thus reveal that centromere associations are a component of the timing and progression of chromosome synapsis, and the gradual release of the individual centromeres from the clusters correlates with the elongation of interstitial synapsis between the corresponding homologues.},

  abstract = {High-density genetic maps are essential for high resolution mapping of quantitative traits. Here, we present a new genetic map for an Arabidopsis Bayreuth {\texttimes} Shahdara recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, built on RNA-seq data. RNA-seq analysis on 160 RILs of this population identified 30,049 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the whole genome. Based on a 100-kbp window SNP binning method, 1059 bin-markers were identified, physically anchored on the genome. The total length of the RNA-seq genetic map spans 471.70 centimorgans (cM) with an average marker distance of 0.45 cM and a maximum marker distance of 4.81 cM. This high resolution genotyping revealed new recombination breakpoints in the population. To highlight the advantages of such high-density map, we compared it to two publicly available genetic maps for the same population, comprising 69 PCR-based markers and 497 gene expression markers derived from microarray data, respectively. In this study, we show that SNP markers can effectively be derived from RNA-seq data. The new RNA-seq map closes many existing gaps in marker coverage, saturating the previously available genetic maps. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for published phenotypes using the available genetic maps showed increased QTL mapping resolution and reduced QTL confidence interval using the RNA-seq map. The new high-density map is a valuable resource that facilitates the identification of candidate genes and map-based cloning approaches.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal crossovers, which generate genetic diversity and underpin classical crop improvement. Meiotic recombination initiates from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are processed into single-stranded DNA that can invade a homologous chromosome. The resulting joint molecules can ultimately be resolved as crossovers. In               Arabidopsis               , competing pathways balance the repair of {$\sim$}100{\textendash}200 meiotic DSBs into {$\sim$}10 crossovers per meiosis, with the excess DSBs repaired as noncrossovers. To bias DSB repair toward crossovers, we simultaneously increased dosage of the procrossover E3 ligase gene               HEI10               and introduced mutations in the anticrossovers helicase genes               RECQ4A               and               RECQ4B               .

Interestingly, we also show that increased               HEI10               dosage increases crossover coincidence, which indicates an effect on interference. We also show that patterns of interhomolog polymorphism and heterochromatin drive recombination increases distally towards the subtelomeres in both               HEI10               and               recq4a recq4b               backgrounds, while the centromeres remain crossover suppressed. These results provide a genetic framework for engineering meiotic recombination landscapes in plant genomes.},

  abstract = {Dramatic changes in climatic conditions that supplement the biotic and abiotic stresses pose severe threat to the sustainable rice production and have made it a difficult task for rice molecular breeders to enhance production and productivity under these stress factors. The main focus of rice molecular breeders is to understand the fundamentals of molecular pathways involved in complex agronomic traits to increase the yield. The availability of complete rice genome sequence and recent improvements in rice genomics research has made it possible to detect and map accurately a large number of genes by using linkage to DNA markers. Linkage mapping is an effective approach to identify the genetic markers which are co-segregating with target traits within the family. The ideas of genetic diversity, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) are evolving into more efficient concepts of linkage disequilibrium (LD) also called association mapping and genomic selection (GS), respectively. The use of cost-effective DNA markers derived from the fine mapped position of the genes for important agronomic traits will provide opportunities for breeders to develop high-yielding, stress-resistant, and better quality rice cultivars. Here we focus on the progress of molecular marker technologies, their application in genetic mapping and evolution of association mapping techniques in rice.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a highly conserved process that has profound effects on genome evolution. At a fine-scale, recombination rates can vary drastically across genomes, often localized into small recombination ``hotspots'' with highly elevated rates, surrounded by regions with little recombination. In most species studied, the location of hotspots within genomes is highly conserved across broad evolutionary timescales. The main exception to this pattern is in mammals, where hotspot location can evolve rapidly among closely related species and even among populations within a species. Hotspot position in mammals is controlled by the gene, Prdm9, whereas in species with conserved hotspots, a functional Prdm9 is typically absent. Due to a limited number of species where recombination rates have been estimated at a fine-scale, it remains unclear whether hotspot conservation is always associated with the absence of a functional Prdm9. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are an excellent model to examine the evolution of recombination over short evolutionary timescales. Using a linkage disequilibrium-based approach, we found recombination rates indeed varied at a fine-scale across the genome, with many regions organized into narrow hotspots. Hotspots had highly divergent landscapes between stickleback populations, where only \$15\% of these hotspots were shared. Our results indicate that fine-scale recombination rates may be diverging between closely related populations of threespine stickleback fish. Interestingly, we found only a weak association of a PRDM9 binding motif within hotspots, which suggests that threespine stickleback fish may possess a novel mechanism for targeting recombination hotspots at a fine-scale.},

To identify which forces have shaped the genomic landscapes in             Populus             , we resequenced 201 whole-genomes from eight closely related species, with pairs of species at different stages along the speciation continuum. Using population structure and identity by descent analyses, we show extensive introgression between some species pairs, especially those with parapatric distributions. Inference of historical changes in effective population sizes support species-specific demographic trajectories, including recent population expansions in species characterized by broad present-day distributions. We observe highly conserved genomic landscapes, either focusing on within-species (genetic diversity:             {$\pi$}             and recombination rate:             {$\rho$}             ) or among-species variation (relative divergence:                            F               ST                          and absolute divergence:                            D               XY                          ).

However, the positive correlations between             {$\pi$}             and                            D               XY                          became weaker as the overall divergence level (                            d               a                          ) increased, suggesting that background selection is not the only factor at play.

  abstract = {There are clear theoretical reasons and many well-documented examples which show that repetitive DNA is essential for genome function. Generic repeated signals in the DNA are necessary to format expression of unique coding sequence files and to organise additional functions essential for genome replication and accurate transmission to progeny cells. Repetitive DNA sequence elements are also fundamental to the cooperative molecular interactions forming nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we review the surprising abundance of repetitive DNA in many genomes, describe its structural diversity, and discuss dozens of cases where the functional importance of repetitive elements has been studied in molecular detail. In particular, the fact that repeat elements serve either as initiators or boundaries for heterochromatin domains and provide a significant fraction of scaffolding/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) suggests that the repetitive component of the genome plays a major architectonic role in higher order physical structuring. Employing an information science model, the ` functionalist ' perspective on repetitive DNA leads to new ways of thinking about the systemic organisation of cellular genomes and provides several novel possibilities involving repeat elements in evolutionarily significant genome reorganisation. These ideas may facilitate the interpretation of comparisons between sequenced genomes, where the repetitive DNA component is often greater than the coding sequence component.},

  abstract = {The genome of potato, a major global food crop, was recently sequenced. The work presented here details the integration of the potato reference genome (DM) with a new sequence-tagged site marker2based linkage map and other physical and genetic maps of potato and the closely related species tomato. Primary anchoring of the DM genome assembly was accomplished by the use of a diploid segregating population, which was genotyped with several types of molecular genetic markers to construct a new {\textasciitilde}936 cM linkage map comprising 2469 marker loci. In silico anchoring approaches used genetic and physical maps from the diploid potato genotype RH89-039-16 (RH) and tomato. This combined approach has allowed 951 superscaffolds to be ordered into pseudomolecules corresponding to the 12 potato chromosomes. These pseudomolecules represent 674 Mb ({\textasciitilde}93\%) of the 723 Mb genome assembly and 37,482 ({\textasciitilde}96\%) of the 39,031 predicted genes. The superscaffold order and orientation within the pseudomolecules are closely collinear with independently constructed high density linkage maps. Comparisons between marker distribution and physical location reveal regions of greater and lesser recombination, as well as regions exhibiting significant segregation distortion. The work presented here has led to a greatly improved ordering of the potato reference genome superscaffolds into chromosomal ``pseudomolecules''.},

  abstract = {Recombination is crucial for genetic evolution, which not only provides new allele combinations but also influences the biological evolution and efficacy of natural selection. However, recombination variation is not well understood outside of the complex species' genomes, and it is particularly unclear in Gossypium. Cotton is the most important natural fibre crop and the second largest oil-seed crop. Here, we found that the genetic and physical maps distances did not have a simple linear relationship. Recombination rates were unevenly distributed throughout the cotton genome, which showed marked changes along the chromosome lengths and recombination was completely suppressed in the centromeric regions. Recombination rates significantly varied between A-subgenome (At) (range = 1.60 to 3.26 centimorgan/megabase [cM/Mb]) and D-subgenome (Dt) (range = 2.17 to 4.97 cM/Mb), which explained why the genetic maps of At and Dt are similar but the physical map of Dt is only half that of At. The translocation regions between A02 and A03 and between A04 and A05, and the inversion regions on A10, D10, A07 and D07 indicated relatively high recombination rates in the distal regions of the chromosomes. Recombination rates were positively correlated with the densities of genes, markers and the distance from the centromere, and negatively correlated with transposable elements (TEs). The gene ontology (GO) categories showed that genes in high recombination regions may tend to response to environmental stimuli, and genes in low recombination regions are related to mitosis and meiosis, which suggested that they may provide the primary driving force in adaptive evolution and assure the stability of basic cell cycle in a rapidly changing environment. Global knowledge of recombination rates will facilitate genetics and breeding in cotton.},

  abstract = {In budding yeast, the ZMM complex is closely associated with class I crossovers and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. However, the relationship among the ZMM genes remains unclear in most higher eukaryotes. Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1. Our results show that in the rice zip4 mutant the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced, although synapsis proceeds with only mild defects. Immunocytological analyses of wild type reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and co-localizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes. Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa. Double mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but the contributions of them are not completely identical in rice. Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show an even more reduced chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants. These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 may be required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For most sequenced flowering plants, multiple whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are found. Duplicated genes following WGD often have different fates that can quickly disappear again, be retained for long(er) periods, or subsequently undergo small-scale duplications. However, how different expression, epigenetic regulation, and functional constraints are associated with these different gene fates following a WGD still requires further investigation due to successive WGDs in angiosperms complicating the gene trajectories. In this study, we investigate lotus (Nelumbo nucifera), an angiosperm with a single WGD during the K{\textendash}pg boundary. Based on improved intraspecific-synteny identification by a chromosome-level assembly, transcriptome, and bisulfite sequencing, we explore not only the fundamental distinctions in genomic features, expression, and methylation patterns of genes with different fates after a WGD but also the factors that shape post-WGD expression divergence and expression bias between duplicates. We found that after a WGD genes that returned to single copies show the highest levels and breadth of expression, gene body methylation, and intron numbers, whereas the long-retained duplicates exhibit the highest degrees of protein{\textendash}protein interactions and protein lengths and the lowest methylation in gene flanking regions. For those long-retained duplicate pairs, the degree of expression divergence correlates with their sequence divergence, degree in protein{\textendash}protein interactions, and expression level, whereas their biases in expression level reflecting subgenome dominance are associated with the bias of subgenome fractionation. Overall, our study on the paleopolyploid nature of lotus highlights the impact of different functional constraints on gene fate and duplicate divergence following a single WGD in plant.},

The DSB activity of SPO11 was shown by genetic analyses, but whether SPO11 exerts DSB-forming activity by itself is still an unanswered question. DSB formation by SPO11 has not been detected by biochemical means, probably because of a lack of proper protein-folding, posttranslational modifications, and/or specific SPO11-interacting proteins required for this activity. In addition, plants have multiple SPO11-homologues.                                         Results                                To determine whether SPO11 can cleave DNA by itself, and to identify which plant SPO11 homologue cleaves DNA, we developed a                 Drosophila                 bioassay system that detects the DSB signals generated by a plant SPO11 homologue expressed ectopically. We cytologically and genetically demonstrated the DSB activities of                 Arabidopsis                 AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, which are required for meiosis, in the absence of other plant proteins. Using this bioassay, we further found that a novel SPO11-homologue, OsSPO11D, which has no counterpart in                 Arabidopsis                 , displays prominent DSB-forming activity. Quantitative analyses of the rice SPO11 transcripts revealed the specific increase in OsSPO11D mRNA in the anthers containing meiotic pollen mother cells.                                                        Conclusions                                The                 Drosophila                 bioassay system successfully demonstrated that some plant SPO11 orthologues have intrinsic DSB activities. Furthermore, we identified a novel SPO11 homologue, OsSPO11D, with robust DSB activity and a possible meiotic function.},

  abstract = {Background: Verticillium wilt (VW) caused by Verticillium dahliae (Kleb) is one of the most destructive diseases of cotton. The identification of highly resistant QTLs or genes in the whole cotton genome is quite important for developing a VW-resistant variety and for further molecular design breeding. Results: In the present study, BC1F1, BC1S1, and BC2F1 populations derived from an interspecific backcross between the highly resistant line Hai1 (Gossypium barbadense L.) and the susceptible variety CCRI36 (G. hirsutum L.) as the recurrent parent were constructed. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to VW resistance were detected in the whole cotton genome using a high-density simple sequence repeat (SSR) genetic linkage map from the BC1F1 population, with 2292 loci covering 5115.16 centiMorgan (cM) of the cotton (AD) genome, and the data concerning VW resistance that were obtained from four dates of BC2F1 in the artificial disease nursery and one date of BC1S1 and BC2F1 in the field. A total of 48 QTLs for VW resistance were identified, and 37 of these QTLs had positive additive effects, which indicated that the G. barbadense alleles increased resistance to VW and decreased the disease index (DI) by about 2.2{\textendash}10.7. These QTLs were located on 19 chromosomes, in which 33 in the A subgenome and 15 QTLs in the D subgenome. The 6 QTLs were found to be stable. The 6 QTLs were consistent with those identified previously, and another 42 were new, unreported QTLs, of which 31 QTLs were from G. barbadense. By metaanalysis, 17 QTL hotspot regions were identified and 10 of them were new, unreported hotspot regions. 29 QTLs in this paper were in 12 hotspot regions and were all from G. barbadense. Conclusions: These stable or consensus QTL regions warrant further investigation to better understand the genetics and molecular mechanisms underlying VW resistance. This study provides useful information for further comparative analysis and marker-assisted selection in the breeding of disease-resistant cotton. It may also lay an important foundation for gene cloning and further molecular design breeding for the entire cotton genome.},

To promote more genetic and genomic studies and to enhance breeding programmes of R. sativus, we have prepared genetic resources such as complementary DNA libraries, expressed sequences tags (ESTs), simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a genetic linkage map. A total of 26 606 ESTs have been collected from seedlings, roots, leaves, and flowers, and clustered into 10 381 unigenes. Similarities were observed between the expression patterns of transcripts from R. sativus and those from representative members of the genera Arabidopsis and Brassica, indicating their functional relatedness. The EST sequence data were used to design 3800 SSR markers and consequently 630 polymorphic SSR loci and 213 reported marker loci have been mapped onto nine linkage groups, covering 1129.2 cM with an average distance of 1.3 cM between loci. Comparison of the mapped EST-SSR marker positions in R. sativus with the genome sequence of A. thaliana indicated that the Brassicaceae members have evolved from a common ancestor. It appears that genomic fragments corresponding to those of A. thaliana have been doubled and tripled in R. sativus. The genetic map developed here is expected to provide a standard map for the genetics, genomics, and molecular breeding of R. sativus as well as of related species.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Theory predicts that the ability for natural selection to remove deleterious mutations from a population, and prevent the accumulation of genetic load, is a function of the effective population size (N             e             ). Shifts from random mating to self-fertilization (``selfing'') are predicted to decrease N             e             through a variety of genomic changes - including a reduction in effective recombination and an increase in homozygosity. While a long history of theory suggests that the efficacy of selection, particularly against non-recessive mutations, should decrease with selfing rate, comparisons of genomic-based estimates of the efficacy of selection between related outcrosser-selfer pairs have revealed conflicting results. We address this paradox by simulating the evolution of strongly deleterious recessive and weakly deleterious additive mutations across a range of recombination, mutation and selective parameter combinations. We find that the genetic load of a population can either increase, decrease, or not vary with selfing rate. Genetic load is higher in selfers only when recombination rates are greater than mutation rates. When recombination rates are lower than mutation rates, an accumulation of recessive mutations leads to pseudo-overdominance, a type of balancing selection, in outcrossing populations. Using both simulations and analytical theory, we show that pseudo-overdominance has strong negative effects on the efficacy of selection against linked additive mutations and that a threshold level of selfing prevents pseudo-overdominance. Our results show that selection can be more or less effective in selfers as compared to outcrossers depending on the relationship between the deleterious mutation rate and gene density, and therefore different genomic regions in different taxa could show differing results.},

A popular approach, called the Marey map approach, relies on comparing genetic and physical maps of a chromosome to estimate local recombination rates. In the past, we have implemented this approach in an R package called MareyMap, which includes many functionalities useful to get reliable recombination rate estimates in a semi-automated way. MareyMap has been used repeatedly in studies looking at the effect of recombination on genome evolution. Here, we propose a simpler user-friendly web service version of MareyMap, called MareyMap Online, which allows a user to get recombination rates from her/his own data or from a publicly available database that we offer in a few clicks. When the analysis is done, the user is asked whether her/his curated data can be placed in the database and shared with other users, which we hope will make meta-analysis on recombination rates including many species easy in the future.},

  abstract = {The genome sizes of eukaryotes may differ as much as 10,400-fold. A part of these differences may be attributed to polyploidy, and increase in gene number and size. Most of the genome size disparity is due to non-transcribed repeated DNA including retrotransposons and pseudogenes. Only a small fraction of the larger genomes such as those of many crop plants, contain genes. Genes are distributed unevenly along the chromosomes, often organized in clusters of varying sizes and gene-densities (gene-rich regions). The regions corresponding to gene-clusters in smaller genome plants such as rice may be divided into many `mini' gene-clusters in the related larger genomes. The range of gene-density within the `mini' gene-clusters is about the same among plants with varying genome sizes. Recombination per chromosome is similar among eukaryotes, and thus is considerably independent of DNA content and chromosome size. Relatively little recombination occurs outside the gene-rich regions. Recombination varies dramatically among various gene regions, and is highly uneven within gene regions as well. Consequently, a significant number of genes may be inaccessible to recombination-based manipulations such as map-based cloning.},

We hypothesized that adaptive changes in recombination may be associated with adaptive evolution patterns of genes involved in meiotic recombination. Results: To examine how maize evolution and domestication affected meiotic recombination genes, we studied patterns of sequence polymorphism and divergence in eleven genes controlling key steps in the meiotic recombination pathway in a diverse set of maize inbred lines and several accessions of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize.

  abstract = {During meiotic recombination, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed in chromosomal DNA and then repaired as either crossovers (COs) or non{\textendash}crossovers (NCOs). In most taxa, the number of DSBs vastly exceeds the number of COs. COs are required for generating genetic diversity in the progeny, as well as proper chromosome segregation. Their formation is tightly controlled so that there is at least one CO per pair of homologous chromosomes whereas the maximum number of COs per chromosome pair is fairly limited. One of the main mechanisms controlling the number of recombination events per meiosis is CO homeostasis, which maintains a stable CO number even when the DSB number is dramatically altered. The existence of CO homeostasis has been reported in several species, including mouse, yeast, and               Caenorhabditis elegans               . However, it is not known whether homeostasis exists in the same form in all species. In addition, the studies of homeostasis have been conducted using mutants and/or transgenic lines exhibiting fairly severe meiotic phenotypes, and it is unclear how important homeostasis is under normal physiological conditions. We found that, in maize, CO control is robust only to ensure one CO per chromosome pair. However, once this limit is reached, the CO number is linearly related to the DSB number. We propose that CO control is a multifaceted process whose different aspects have a varying degree of importance in different species.},

  abstract = {Recombination: The birds and the yeast                            Apes and mice have a specific gene,               PRDM9               , that is associated with genomic regions with high rates of recombination, called hotspots. In species with               PRDM9               , hotspots move rapidly within the genome, varying among populations and closely related species (see the Perspective by Lichten). To investigate recombination hotspots in species lacking               PRDM9               , Singhal               et al.               examined bird genomes, which lack a               PRDM9               gene. They looked closely at the genomes of finch species and found that recombination was localized to the promoter regions of genes and highly conserved over millions of years. Similarly, Lam and Keeney examined recombination localization within yeast, which also lacks               PRDM9               . They found a similar more-or-less fixed pattern of hotspots. Thus, recombination in species lacking a               PRDM9               gene shows similar patterns of hotspot localization and evolution.

[Also see Perspective by                 Lichten                 ]                                       ,                             The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 has a critical role in specifying meiotic recombination hotspots in mice and apes, but it appears to be absent from other vertebrate species, including birds. To study the evolution and determinants of recombination in species lacking the gene that encodes PRDM9, we inferred fine-scale genetic maps from population resequencing data for two bird species: the zebra finch,               Taeniopygia guttata               , and the long-tailed finch,               Poephila acuticauda               . We found that both species have recombination hotspots, which are enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in mice and apes, most hotspots are shared between the two species, and their conservation seems to extend over tens of millions of years. These observations suggest that in the absence of PRDM9, recombination targets functional features that both enable access to the genome and constrain its evolution.},

An emerging insight from analyses of genome-wide polymorphism and divergence data is that selection on linked sites can have an important impact on neutral genetic variation. However, in contrast to Drosophila, which exhibits a signature of recurrent hitchhiking, many plant genomes studied so far seem to mainly be affected by background selection. Moreover, many plants do not exhibit classic signatures of linked selection, such as a correlation between recombination rate and neutral diversity. In this review, I discuss the impact of genome architecture and mating system on the expected signature of linked selection in plants and review empirical evidence for linked selection, with a focus on plant model systems. Finally, I discuss the implications of linked selection for inference of demographic history in plants.},

We measured performance in two ways: accuracy when the sequence data were simulated according to the (simplistic) standard model underlying the methods and robustness to violations of many different aspects of the standard model. Although we found some differences between the methods, performance tended to be similar for all three methods. Despite the fact that the methods are not robust to violations of the underlying model, our simulations indicate that patterns of relative recombination rates should be inferred reasonably well even if the standard model does not hold. In addition, we assess various techniques for improving the performance of approximate-likelihood methods. In particular we find that the compositelikelihood method of Hudson (2001) can be improved by including log-likelihood contributions only for pairs of sites that are separated by some prespecified distance.},

  abstract = {Summary                            When a selectively favourable gene substitution occurs in a population, changes in gene frequencies will occur at closely linked loci. In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 10               6               or more (and perhaps of 10               4               or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (-               Nc               ), where               c               is the recombinant fraction and               N               the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

  abstract = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in animal populations has been a successful strategy for identifying genomic regions that play a role in complex diseases and traits. When conducted in an F2 intercross or backcross population, the resulting QTL is frequently large, often encompassing 30 Mb or more and containing hundreds of genes. To narrow the locus and identify candidate genes, additional strategies are needed. Congenic strains have proven useful but work less well when there are multiple tightly linked loci, frequently resulting in loss of phenotype. As an alternative, we discuss the use of highly recombinant outbred models for directly fine-mapping QTL to only a few megabases. We discuss the use of several currently available models such as the advanced intercross (AI), heterogeneous stocks (HS), the diversity outbred (DO), and commercially available outbred stocks (CO). Once a QTL has been fine-mapped, founder sequence and expression QTL mapping can be used to identify candidate genes. In this regard, the large number of alleles found in outbred stocks can be leveraged to identify causative genes and variants. We end this review by discussing some important statistical considerations when analyzing outbred populations. Fine-resolution mapping in outbred models, coupled with full genome sequence, has already led to the identification of several underlying causative genes for many complex traits and diseases. These resources will likely lead to additional successes in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Background: The honey bee is a key model for social behavior and this feature led to the selection of the species for genome sequencing. A genetic map is a necessary companion to the sequence. In addition, because there was originally no physical map for the honey bee genome project, a meiotic map was the only resource for organizing the sequence assembly on the chromosomes. Results: We present the genetic (meiotic) map here and describe the main features that emerged from comparison with the sequence-based physical map. The genetic map of the honey bee is saturated and the chromosomes are oriented from the centromeric to the telomeric regions. The map is based on 2,008 markers and is about 40 Morgans (M) long, resulting in a marker density of one every 2.05 centiMorgans (cM). For the 186 megabases (Mb) of the genome mapped and assembled, this corresponds to a very high average recombination rate of 22.04 cM/Mb. Honey bee meiosis shows a relatively homogeneous recombination rate along and across chromosomes, as well as within and between individuals. Interference is higher than inferred from the Kosambi function of distance. In addition, numerous recombination hotspots are dispersed over the genome. Conclusion: The very large genetic length of the honey bee genome, its small physical size and an almost complete genome sequence with a relatively low number of genes suggest a very promising future for association mapping in the honey bee, particularly as the existence of haploid males allows easy bulk segregant analysis.},

  abstract = {Thousands of species will be sequenced in the next few years; however, understanding how their genomes work, without an unlimited budget, requires both molecular and novel evolutionary approaches. We developed a sensitive sequence alignment pipeline to identify conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the Andropogoneae tribe (multiple crop species descended from a common ancestor {$\sim$}18 million years ago). The Andropogoneae share similar physiology while being tremendously genomically diverse, harboring a broad range of ploidy levels, structural variation, and transposons. These contribute to the potential of Andropogoneae as a powerful system for studying CNSs and are factors we leverage to understand the function of maize CNSs. We found that 86\% of CNSs were comprised of annotated features, including introns, UTRs, putative               cis               -regulatory elements, chromatin loop anchors, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and several transposable element superfamilies. CNSs were enriched in active regions of DNA replication in the early S phase of the mitotic cell cycle and showed different DNA methylation ratios compared to the genome-wide background. More than half of putative               cis               -regulatory sequences (identified via other methods) overlapped with CNSs detected in this study. Variants in CNSs were associated with gene expression levels, and CNS absence contributed to loss of gene expression. Furthermore, the evolution of CNSs was associated with the functional diversification of duplicated genes in the context of maize subgenomes. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the molecular processes governing the evolution of CNSs in maize.},

  abstract = {Micro-exons are a kind of exons with lengths no more than 51 nucleotides. They are generally ignored in genome annotation due to the short length, whereas recent studies indicate that they have special splicing properties and important functions. Considering that there has been no genome-wide study of micro-exons in plants up to now, we screened and analyzed genes containing micro-exons in two indica rice varieties in this study. According to the annotation of Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Minghui 63 (MH63), {\textasciitilde}23\% of genes possess micro-exons. We then identified micro-exons from RNA-seq data and found that {$>$}65\% micro-exons had been annotated and most of novel micro-exons were located in gene regions. About 60\% micro-exons were constitutively spliced, and the others were alternatively spliced in different tissues. Besides, we observed that approximately 54\% of genes harboring micro-exons tended to be ancient genes, and 13\% were Oryza genus-specific. Micro-exon genes were highly conserved in Oryza genus with consistent domains. In particular, the predicted protein structures showed that alternative splicing of in-frame micro-exons led to a local structural recombination, which might affect some core structure of domains, and alternative splicing of frame-shifting micro-exons usually resulted in premature termination of translation by introducing a stop codon or missing functional domains. Overall, our study provided the genome-wide distribution, evolutionary conservation, and potential functions of micro-exons in rice.},

L1 insertions have occasionally been recruited to perform a beneficial function but the vast majority of L1 inserts are either neutral or deleterious. The basis for the deleterious effect of L1 remains a matter of debate and three possible mechanisms have been suggested: the direct effect of L1 inserts on gene activity, genetic rearrangements caused by L1-mediated ectopic recombination, or the retrotransposition process per se. We performed a genome-wide analysis of the distribution of L1 retrotransposons relative to the local recombination rate and the age and length of the elements. The proportion of L1 elements that are longer than 1.2 Kb is higher in low-recombining regions of the genome than in regions with a high recombination rate, but the genomic distributions of full-length elements (i.e. elements capable of retrotransposition) and long truncated elements were indistinguishable. We also found that the intensity of selection against long elements is proportional to the replicative success of L1 families. This suggests that the deleterious effect of L1 elements results principally from their ability to mediate ectopic recombination.},

Maternal and paternal genetic maps were constructed on the basis of an F1 progeny derived from crossing an artichoke genotype (Mola) with its progenitor, the wild cardoon (Tolfa), using EST-derived SSRs, genomic SSRs, AFLPs, ten genes, and two morphological traits. For most genes, mainly belonging to the chlorogenic acid pathway, new markers were developed. Five of these were SNP markers analyzed through highresolution melt technology. From the maternal (Mola) and paternal (Tolfa) maps, an integrated map was obtained, containing 337 molecular and one morphological markers ordered in 17 linkage groups (LGs), linked between Mola and Tolfa. The integrated map covers 1,488.8 cM, with an average distance of 4.4 cM between markers. The map was aligned with already existing maps for artichoke, and 12 LGs were linked via 31 bridge markers. LG numbering has been proposed. A total of 124 EST-SSRs and two genes were mapped here for the first time, providing a framework for the construction of a functional map in artichoke. The establishment of a consensus map represents a necessary condition to plan a complete sequencing of the globe artichoke genome.},

  abstract = {Background: Cassava, Manihot esculenta Crantz, is one of the most important crops world-wide representing the staple security for more than one billion of people. The development of dense genetic and physical maps, as the basis for implementing genetic and molecular approaches to accelerate the rate of genetic gains in breeding program represents a significant challenge. A reference genome sequence for cassava has been made recently available and community efforts are underway for improving its quality. Cassava is threatened by several pathogens, but the mechanisms of defense are far from being understood. Besides, there has been a lack of information about the number of genes related to immunity as well as their distribution and genomic organization in the cassava genome. Results: A high dense genetic map of cassava containing 2,141 SNPs has been constructed. Eighteen linkage groups were resolved with an overall size of 2,571 cM and an average distance of 1.26 cM between markers. More than half of mapped SNPs (57.4\%) are located in coding sequences. Physical mapping of scaffolds of cassava whole genome sequence draft using the mapped markers as anchors resulted in the orientation of 687 scaffolds covering 45.6\% of the genome. One hundred eighty nine new scaffolds are anchored to the genetic cassava map leading to an extension of the present cassava physical map with 30.7 Mb. Comparative analysis using anchor markers showed strong co-linearity to previously reported cassava genetic and physical maps. In silico based searching for conserved domains allowed the annotation of a repertory of 1,061 cassava genes coding for immunity-related proteins (IRPs). Based on physical map of the corresponding sequencing scaffolds, unambiguous genetic localization was possible for 569 IRPs. Conclusions: This is the first study reported so far of an integrated high density genetic map using SNPs with integrated genetic and physical localization of newly annotated immunity related genes in cassava. These data build a solid basis for future studies to map and associate markers with single loci or quantitative trait loci for agronomical important traits. The enrichment of the physical map with novel scaffolds is in line with the efforts of the cassava genome sequencing consortium.},

Among those that do are Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae), Rumex acetosa (Polygonaceae) and Coccinia grandis (Cucurbitaceae), the latter having a male/female difference of 10\% of the total genome (female individuals have a 0.85 pg genome, male individuals 0.94 pg), due to a Y chromosome that arose about 3 million years ago. We compared the sequence composition of male and female C. grandis plants and determined the chromosomal distribution of repetitive and organellar DNA with probes developed from 21 types of repetitive DNA, including 16 mobile elements. The size of the Y chromosome is largely due to the accumulation of certain repeats, such as members of the Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy superfamilies, an unclassified element and a satellite, but also plastome- and chondriomederived sequences. An abundant tandem repeat with a unit size of 144 bp stains the centromeres of the X chromosome and the autosomes, but is absent from the Y centromere. Immunostaining with pericentromere-specific markers for anti-histone H3Ser10ph and H2AThr120ph revealed a Y-specific extension of these histone marks. That the Y centromere has a different make-up from all the remaining centromeres raises questions about its spindle attachment, and suggests that centromeric or pericentromeric chromatin might be involved in the suppression of recombination.},

Studying cross-population differences has been stymied by the confounding effects of demographic history. To address this problem, we developed a demography-aware method to infer fine-scale recombination rates and applied it to 26 diverse human populations, inferring population-specific recombination maps. These maps recapitulate many aspects of the history of these populations including signatures of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Iberian colonization of the Americas. We also investigated modulators of the local recombination rate, finding further evidence that Polycomb group proteins and the trimethylation of H3K27 elevate recombination rates. Further differences in the recombination landscape across the genome and between populations are driven by variation in the gene that encodes the DNA binding protein PRDM9, and we quantify the weak effect of meiotic drive acting to remove its binding sites.},

We use a combination of analyses of allele-specific expression and population genomic analyses to investigate the selective forces and genomic determinants of               cis-               regulatory variation in the outcrossing plant species               Capsella grandiflora               .

Finally, we identify a link between gene body methylation and the extent of               cis-               regulatory constraint in natural populations.                        ,                             Understanding the causes of               cis-               regulatory variation is a long-standing aim in evolutionary biology. Although               cis               -regulatory variation has long been considered important for adaptation, we still have a limited understanding of the selective importance and genomic determinants of standing               cis-               regulatory variation. To address these questions, we studied the prevalence, genomic determinants, and selective forces shaping               cis-               regulatory variation in the outcrossing plant               Capsella grandiflora               . We first identified a set of 1,010 genes with common               cis-               regulatory variation using analyses of allele-specific expression (ASE). Population genomic analyses of whole-genome sequences from 32 individuals showed that genes with common               cis-               regulatory variation (               i               ) are under weaker purifying selection and (               ii               ) undergo less frequent positive selection than other genes. We further identified genomic determinants of               cis-               regulatory variation. Gene body methylation (gbM) was a major factor constraining               cis-               regulatory variation, whereas presence of nearby transposable elements (TEs) and tissue specificity of expression increased the odds of ASE. Our results suggest that most common               cis-               regulatory variation in               C. grandiflora               is under weak purifying selection, and that gene-specific functional constraints are more important for the maintenance of               cis-               regulatory variation than genome-scale variation in the intensity of selection. Our results agree with previous findings that suggest TE silencing affects nearby gene expression, and provide evidence for a link between gbM and               cis-               regulatory constraint, possibly reflecting greater dosage sensitivity of body-methylated genes. Given the extensive conservation of gbM in flowering plants, this suggests that gbM could be an important predictor of               cis-               regulatory variation in a wide range of plant species.},

  abstract = {For over a century, scientists have known that meiotic recombination rates can vary considerably among individuals, and that environmental conditions can modify recombination rates relative to the background. A variety of external and intrinsic factors such as temperature, age, sex and starvation can elicit `plastic' responses in recombination rate. The influence of recombination rate plasticity on genetic diversity of the next generation has interesting and important implications for how populations evolve. Further, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms and molecular processes that contribute to recombination rate plasticity. Here, we review 100 years of experimental work on recombination rate plasticity conducted in               Drosophila melanogaster               . We categorize this work into four major classes of experimental designs, which we describe via classic studies in               D. melanogaster               . Based on these studies, we highlight molecular mechanisms that are supported by experimental results and relate these findings to studies in other systems. We synthesize lessons learned from this model system into experimental guidelines for using recent advances in genotyping technologies, to study recombination rate plasticity in non-model organisms. Specifically, we recommend (1) using fine-scale genome-wide markers, (2) collecting time-course data, (3) including crossover distribution measurements, and (4) using mixed effects models to analyse results. To illustrate this approach, we present an application adhering to these guidelines from empirical work we conducted in               Drosophila pseudoobscura               .

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the majority of flowering plant DNA, reflecting their tremendous success in subverting, avoiding, and surviving the defenses of their host genomes to ensure their selfish replication. More than 85\% of the sequence of the maize genome can be ascribed to past transposition, providing a major contribution to the structure of the genome. Evidence from individual loci has informed our understanding of how transposition has shaped the genome, and a number of individual TE insertions have been causally linked to dramatic phenotypic changes. Genome-wide analyses in maize and other taxa have frequently represented TEs as a relatively homogeneous class of fragmentary relics of past transposition, obscuring their evolutionary history and interaction with their host genome. Using an updated annotation of structurally intact TEs in the maize reference genome, we investigate the family-level dynamics of TEs in maize. Integrating a variety of data, from descriptors of individual TEs like coding capacity, expression, and methylation, as well as similar features of the sequence they inserted into, we model the relationship between attributes of the genomic environment and the survival of TE copies and families. In contrast to the wholesale relegation of all TEs to a single category of junk DNA, these differences reveal a diversity of survival strategies of TE families. Together these generate a rich ecology of the genome, with each TE family representing the evolution of a distinct ecological niche. We conclude that while the impact of transposition is highly family- and context-dependent, a family-level understanding of the ecology of TEs in the genome can refine our ability to predict the role of TEs in generating genetic and phenotypic diversity.},

  abstract = {Transposable element (TE) activity has emerged as a major cause of variation in genome size and structure among species. To what extent TEs contribute to genetic variation and divergence within species, however, is much less clear, mainly because population genomic data have so far only been available for the classical model organisms. In this study, we use the annual Mediterranean grass Brachypodium distachyon to investigate TE dynamics in natural populations. Using whole-genome sequencing data for 53 natural accessions, we identified more than 5,400 TE polymorphisms across the studied genomes. We found, first, that while population bottlenecks and expansions have shaped genetic diversity in B. distachyon, these events did not lead to lineage-specific activations of TE families, as observed in other species. Instead, the same families have been active across the species range and TE activity is homogeneous across populations, indicating the presence of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Second, almost half of the TE insertion polymorphisms are accession-specific, most likely because of recent activity in expanding populations and the action of purifying selection. And finally, although TE insertion polymorphisms are underrepresented in and around genes, more than 1,000 of them occur in genic regions and could thus contribute to functional divergence. Our study shows that while TEs in B. distachyon are ``well-behaved'' compared with TEs in other species with larger genomes, they are an abundant source of lineage-specific genetic variation and may play an important role in population divergence and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is an important driver of evolution. Variability in the intensity of recombination across chromosomes can affect sequence composition, nucleotide variation, and rates of adaptation. In many organisms, recombination events are concentrated within short segments termed recombination hotspots. The variation in recombination rate and positions of recombination hotspot can be studied using population genomics data and statistical methods. In this study, we conducted population genomics analyses to address the evolution of recombination in two closely related fungal plant pathogens: the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and a sister species infecting wild grasses Z. ardabiliae. We specifically addressed whether recombination landscapes, including hotspot positions, are conserved in the two recently diverged species and if recombination contributes to rapid evolution of pathogenicity traits. We conducted a detailed simulation analysis to assess the performance of methods of recombination rate estimation based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, in particular in the context of high nucleotide diversity. Our analyses reveal overall high recombination rates, a lack of suppressed recombination in centromeres, and significantly lower recombination rates on chromosomes that are known to be accessory. The comparison of the recombination landscapes of the two species reveals a strong correlation of recombination rate at the megabase scale, but little correlation at smaller scales. The recombination landscapes in both pathogen species are dominated by frequent recombination hotspots across the genome including coding regions, suggesting a strong impact of recombination on gene evolution. A significant but small fraction of these hotspots colocalize between the two species, suggesting that hotspot dynamics contribute to the overall pattern of fast evolving recombination in these species.},

Candidate genes associated with mechanisms of tolerance to both boron toxicity and time of flowering were identified, which can eventually be used for the development of gene-based markers.

  abstract = {Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a self-pollinating, diploid, annual, cool-season, food legume crop that is cultivated throughout the world. Ascochyta blight (AB), caused by Ascochyta lentis Vassilievsky, is an economically important and widespread disease of lentil. Development of cultivars with high levels of durable resistance provides an environmentally acceptable and economically feasible method for AB control. A detailed understanding of the genetic basis of AB resistance is hence highly desirable, in order to obtain insight into the number and influence of resistance genes. Genetic linkage maps based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed from three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The IH {\texttimes} NF map contained 460 loci across 1461.6 cM, while the IH {\texttimes} DIG map contained 329 loci across 1302.5 cM and the third map, NF {\texttimes} DIG contained 330 loci across 1914.1 cM. Data from these maps were combined with a map from a previously published study through use of bridging markers to generate a consensus linkage map containing 689 loci distributed across seven linkage groups (LGs), with a cumulative length of 2429.61 cM at an average density of one marker per 3.5 cM. Trait dissection of AB resistance was performed for the RIL populations, identifying totals of two and three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining 52 and 69\% of phenotypic variation for resistance to infection in the IH {\texttimes} DIG and IH {\texttimes} NF populations, respectively. Presence of common markers in the vicinity of the AB\_IH1- and AB\_IH2.1/AB\_IH2.2-containing regions on both maps supports the inference that a common genomic region is responsible for conferring resistance and is associated with the resistant parent, Indianhead. The third QTL was derived from Northfield. Evaluation of markers associated with AB resistance across a diverse lentil germplasm panel revealed that the identity of alleles associated with AB\_IH1 predicted the phenotypic responses with high levels of accuracy ({$\sim$}86\%), and therefore have the potential to be widely adopted in lentil breeding programs. The availability of RIL-based maps, a consensus map, and validated markers linked to AB resistance provide important resources for lentil improvement.},

  abstract = {Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a self-pollinating, diploid, annual, cool-season, food legume crop that is cultivated throughout the world. Ascochyta blight (AB), caused by Ascochyta lentis Vassilievsky, is an economically important and widespread disease of lentil. Development of cultivars with high levels of durable resistance provides an environmentally acceptable and economically feasible method for AB control. A detailed understanding of the genetic basis of AB resistance is hence highly desirable, in order to obtain insight into the number and influence of resistance genes. Genetic linkage maps based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed from three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The IH {\texttimes} NF map contained 460 loci across 1461.6 cM, while the IH {\texttimes} DIG map contained 329 loci across 1302.5 cM and the third map, NF {\texttimes} DIG contained 330 loci across 1914.1 cM. Data from these maps were combined with a map from a previously published study through use of bridging markers to generate a consensus linkage map containing 689 loci distributed across seven linkage groups (LGs), with a cumulative length of 2429.61 cM at an average density of one marker per 3.5 cM. Trait dissection of AB resistance was performed for the RIL populations, identifying totals of two and three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining 52 and 69\% of phenotypic variation for resistance to infection in the IH {\texttimes} DIG and IH {\texttimes} NF populations, respectively. Presence of common markers in the vicinity of the AB\_IH1- and AB\_IH2.1/AB\_IH2.2-containing regions on both maps supports the inference that a common genomic region is responsible for conferring resistance and is associated with the resistant parent, Indianhead. The third QTL was derived from Northfield. Evaluation of markers associated with AB resistance across a diverse lentil germplasm panel revealed that the identity of alleles associated with AB\_IH1 predicted the phenotypic responses with high levels of accuracy ({$\sim$}86\%), and therefore have the potential to be widely adopted in lentil breeding programs. The availability of RIL-based maps, a consensus map, and validated markers linked to AB resistance provide important resources for lentil improvement.},

  abstract = {Duplications and deletions in the human genome                            Duplications and deletions can lead to variation in copy number for genes and genomic loci among humans. Such variants can reveal evolutionary patterns and have implications for human health. Sudmant               et al.               examined copy-number variation across 236 individual genomes from 125 human populations. Deletions were under more selection, whereas duplications showed more population-specific structure. Interestingly, Oceanic populations retain large duplications postulated to have originated in an ancient Denisovan lineage.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.aab3761                        ,              Copy-number variation reveals how selection affects the human genome across the globe.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Most studies of human genetic variation have focused on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). However, copy-number variants (CNVs) affect more base pairs of DNA among humans, and yet our understanding of CNV diversity among human populations is limited.                                         RATIONALE               We aimed to understand the pattern, selection, and diversity of copy-number variation by analyzing deeply sequenced genomes representing the diversity of all humans. We compared the selective constraints of deletions versus duplications to understand population stratification in the context of the ancestral human genome and to assess differences in CNV load between African and non-African populations.                                         RESULTS               We sequenced 236 individual genomes from 125 distinct human populations and identified 14,467 autosomal CNVs and 545 X-linked CNVs with a sequence read-depth approach. Deletions exhibit stronger selective pressure and are better phylogenetic markers of population relationships than duplication polymorphisms. We identified 1036 population-stratified copy-number{\textendash}variable regions, 295 of which intersect coding regions and 199 of which exhibit extreme signatures of differentiation. Duplicated loci were 1.8-fold more likely to be stratified than deletions but were poorly correlated with flanking genetic diversity. Among these, we highlight a duplication polymorphism restricted to modern Oceanic populations yet also present in the genome of the archaic Denisova hominin. This 225{\textendash}kilo{\textendash}base pair (kbp) duplication includes two microRNA genes and is almost fixed among human Papuan-Bougainville genomes.               The data allowed us to reconstruct the ancestral human genome and create a more accurate evolutionary framework for the gain and loss of sequences during human evolution. We identified 571 loci that segregate in the human population and another 2026 loci of fixed-copy 2 in all human genomes but absent from the reference genome. The total deletion and duplication load between African and non-African population groups showed no difference after we account for ancestral sequences missing from the human reference. However, we did observe that the relative number of base pairs affected by CNVs compared to single-nucleotide polymorphisms is higher among non-Africans than Africans.                                         CONCLUSION               Deletions, duplications, and CNVs have shaped, to different extents, the genetic diversity of human populations by the combined forces of mutation, selection, and demography.                                Figure                                    Global human CNV diversity and archaic introgression of a chromosome 16 duplication.                                        (                     Left                     ) The geographic coordinates of populations sampled are indicated on a world map (colored dots). The pie charts show the continental population allele frequency of a single {\textasciitilde}225-kbp duplication polymorphism found exclusively among Oceanic populations and an archaic Denisova. (                     Right                     ) The ancestral structure of this duplication locus (1) and the Denisova duplication structure (2) are shown in relation to their position on chromosome 16. We estimate that the duplication emerged {\textasciitilde}440 thousand years ago (ka) in the Denisova and then introgressed into ancestral Papuan populations {\textasciitilde}40 ka.                                                                                            ,              In order to explore the diversity and selective signatures of duplication and deletion human copy-number variants (CNVs), we sequenced 236 individuals from 125 distinct human populations. We observed that duplications exhibit fundamentally different population genetic and selective signatures than deletions and are more likely to be stratified between human populations. Through reconstruction of the ancestral human genome, we identify megabases of DNA lost in different human lineages and pinpoint large duplications that introgressed from the extinct Denisova lineage now found at high frequency exclusively in Oceanic populations. We find that the proportion of CNV base pairs to single-nucleotide{\textendash}variant base pairs is greater among non-Africans than it is among African populations, but we conclude that this difference is likely due to unique aspects of non-African population history as opposed to differences in CNV load.},

  abstract = {The inheritance and function of centromeres are not strictly dependent on any specific DNA sequence, but involve an epigenetic component in most species. CENH3, a centromere histone H3 variant, is one of the best-described epigenetic factors in centromere identity, but the chromatin features required during centromere formation have not yet been revealed. We previously identified two de novo centromeres on Zea mays (maize) minichromosomes derived from euchromatic sites with high-density gene distributions but low-density transposon distributions. The distribution of gene location and gene expression in these sites indicates that transcriptionally active regions can initiate de novo centromere formation, and CENH3 seeding shows a preference for gene-free regions or regions with no gene expression. The locations of the expressed genes detected were at relatively hypomethylated loci, and the altered gene expression resulted from de novo centromere formation, but not from the additional copy of the minichromosome. The initial overall DNA methylation level of the two de novo regions was at a low level, but increased substantially to that of native centromeres after centromere formation. These results illustrate the dynamic chromatin changes during euchromatin-originated de novo centromere formation, which provides insight into the mechanism of de novo centromere formation and regulation of subsequent consequences.},

Although numerous quantitative trait locus (QTL) have been identified, most of them cannot be applied in practical breeding mainly due to environmental instability or large confidence intervals. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate high quality and more stable QTLs by combining linkage mapping and genome-wide association study (GWAS). For linkage mapping, we constructed two F2 populations from crosses of high-oil content ({$\sim$}50\%) lines 6F313 and 61616 with a low-oil content ({$\sim$}40\%) line 51070. Two high density linkage maps spanned 1987 cM (1659 bins) and 1856 cM (1746 bins), respectively. For GWAS, we developed more than 34,000 high-quality SNP markers based on 227 accessions. Finally, 40 QTLs and 29 associations were established by linkage and association mapping in different environments. After merging the results, 32 consensus QTLs were obtained and 7 of them were identified by both mapping methods. Seven overlapping QTLs covered an average confidence interval of 183 kb and explained the phenotypic variation of 10.23 to 24.45\%. We further developed allele-specific PCR primers to identify each of the seven QTLs. These stable QTLs should be useful in gene cloning and practical breeding application.},

We first test this method using a pool of               Arabidopsis               F               2               recombinants, and recapitulate results obtained from the same plants using individual whole-genome sequencing. By applying this method to a pool of pollen DNA from an F               1               plant, we establish a highly accurate CO landscape without generating or sequencing a single recombinant plant. The simplicity of this approach enables the simultaneous generation and analysis of multiple CO landscapes, accelerating the pace at which mechanisms for the regulation of recombination can be elucidated through efficient comparisons of genotypic and environmental effects on recombination.},

  abstract = {Background: Miscanthus (subtribe Saccharinae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae) is a genus of temperate perennial C4 grasses whose high biomass production makes it, along with its close relatives sugarcane and sorghum, attractive as a biofuel feedstock. The base chromosome number of Miscanthus (x = 19) is different from that of other Saccharinae and approximately twice that of the related Sorghum bicolor (x = 10), suggesting largescale duplications may have occurred in recent ancestors of Miscanthus. Owing to the complexity of the Miscanthus genome and the complications of self-incompatibility, a complete genetic map with a high density of markers has not yet been developed. Results: We used deep transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) from two M. sinensis accessions to define 1536 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for a GoldenGate{\texttrademark} genotyping array, and found that simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers defined in sugarcane are often informative in M. sinensis. A total of 658 SNP and 210 SSR markers were validated via segregation in a full sibling F1 mapping population. Using 221 progeny from this mapping population, we constructed a genetic map for M. sinensis that resolves into 19 linkage groups, the haploid chromosome number expected from cytological evidence. Comparative genomic analysis documents a genomewide duplication in Miscanthus relative to Sorghum bicolor, with subsequent insertional fusion of a pair of chromosomes. The utility of the map is confirmed by the identification of two paralogous C4-pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (C4-PPDK) loci in Miscanthus, at positions syntenic to the single orthologous gene in Sorghum. Conclusions: The genus Miscanthus experienced an ancestral tetraploidy and chromosome fusion prior to its diversification, but after its divergence from the closely related sugarcane clade. The recent timing of this tetraploidy complicates discovery and mapping of genetic markers for Miscanthus species, since alleles and fixed differences between paralogs are comparable. These difficulties can be overcome by careful analysis of segregation patterns in a mapping population and genotyping of doubled haploids. The genetic map for Miscanthus will be useful in biological discovery and breeding efforts to improve this emerging biofuel crop, and also provide a valuable resource for understanding genomic responses to tetraploidy and chromosome fusion.},

We review the genetic properties of meiotic recombination and previous models of conversion and crossing-over. In these models, recombination is initiated by single-strand nicks, and heteroduplex DNA is generated. Gene conversion is explained by the repair of mismatches present in heteroduplex DNA. We propose a new mechanism for meiotic recombination, in which events are initiated by double-strand breaks that are enlarged to double-strand gaps. Gene conversion can then occur by the repair of a double-strand gap, and postmeiotic segregation can result from heteroduplex DNA formed at the boundaries of the gap-repair region. The repair of double-strand gaps is an efficient process in yeast, and is known to be associated with crossing-over. The genetic implications of the double-strand-break repair model are explored.},

  author = {Takla, Emad},
  abstract = {Meiotic recombination plays a critical role in the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis and in forming new combinations of genetic material within sexually-reproducing species. For a long time, its side effects were observed as a deviation from the Mendel's principle of independent assortment; however, its molecular mechanisms remain only partially understood until today. We know that it is a highly regulated process and that many molecules are involved in this tight control, resulting in directing meiotic recombination into 1-2 kilobase genomic pairs regions called hotspots. During the past few years, deep learning was successfully applied to the classification of genomic sequences. In this work, we apply deep learning to DNA sequences in order to predict if a specific stretch of DNA is a meiotic recombination hotspot or not. We applied convolution neural networks on a dataset describing the hotspots of four unrelated male individuals, achieving an accuracy of over 88\% with precision and recall above 90\% for the best models. We explored the impact of different input sequence lengths, train/validation split strategies and showing the model the genomic coordinates of the input sequence. We explored different ways to construct the learnt motifs by the network and how they can relate to the classical methods of constructing position-weight-matrices, and we were able to infer relevant biological knowledge uncovered by the network. We also developed a tool for visualizing the different models output in order to help digest the different aspects of the model. Overall, our work shows the ability for deep learning methods to study meiotic recombination from genomic data.},

Here, we contrast populations of the European sub-species             Arabidopsis lyrata             ssp             petraea             , which expanded its Northern range after the last glaciation. We document a sharp decline in effective population size in the range-edge population and observe that non-synonymous variants segregate at higher frequencies. We detect a 4.9\% excess of derived non-synonymous variants per individual, suggesting an increase of the genomic burden of deleterious mutations in the range-edge population. Inference of fitness effects under the explicit demographic history of each population shows that the range-edge population is depleted in rare deleterious variants, but enriched for fixed ones, resulting in a small net difference in per-individual burden between the rangeedge and {\textendash}core populations. Consistent with this prediction, the range-edge population was not impaired in its growth and survival measured in a common garden experiment. We further observe that the allelic diversity at the self-incompatibility locus, which ensures strict outcrossing, has remained unchanged. Genomic footprints indicative of selective sweeps were broader in the Northern population but not less frequent. This indicates that, despite a dramatic bottleneck and a mild expansion load, adaptive mutations were present in sufficient number to maintain adaptive dynamics at the range-edge of the strictly outcrossing species             Arabidopsis lyrata             ssp.             petraea             .},

The consensus map spanned a total length of 1443.84 cM, and consisted of 5,019 SNP markers derived from RAD tag sequencing and 118 publicly available SSR markers distributed in 17 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of sunflower. The maximum interval between markers in the consensus map is 12.37 cM and the average distance is 0.28 cM between adjacent markers. Despite a few shortdistance inversions in marker order, the consensus map showed high levels of collinearity among individual maps with an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.972 across the genome. The order of the SSR markers on the consensus map was also in agreement with the order of the individual map and with previously published sunflower maps. Three individual and one consensus maps revealed the uneven distribution of markers across the genome. Additionally, we performed fine mapping and marker validation of the rust resistance gene R12, providing closely linked SNP markers for marker-assisted selection of this gene in sunflower breeding programs. This high resolution consensus map will serve as a valuable tool to the sunflower community for studying marker-trait association of important agronomic traits, marker assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning, and comparative mapping.},

  abstract = {Although most high-density linkage maps have been constructed from codominant markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites due to their high linkage information, dominant markers can be expected to be even more significant as proteomic technique becomes widely applicable to generate protein polymorphism data from large samples. However, for dominant markers, two possible linkage phases between a pair of markers complicate the estimation of recombination fractions between markers and consequently the construction of linkage maps. The low linkage information of the repulsion phase and high linkage information of coupling phase have led geneticists to construct two separate but related linkage maps. To circumvent this problem, we proposed a new method for estimating the recombination fraction between markers, which greatly improves the accuracy of estimation through distinction between the coupling phase and the repulsion phase of the linked loci. The results obtained from both real and simulated F2 dominant marker data indicate that the recombination fractions estimated by the new method contain a large amount of linkage information for constructing a complete linkage map. In addition, the new method is also applicable to data with mixed types of markers (dominant and codominant) with unknown linkage phase.},

  abstract = {The goal of linkage mapping is to find the true order of loci from a chromosome. Since the number of possible orders is large even for a modest number of loci, the problem of finding the optimal solution is known as a NP-hard problem or traveling salesman problem (TSP). Although a number of algorithms are available, many either are low in the accuracy of recovering the true order of loci or require tremendous amounts of computational resources, thus making them difficult to use for reconstructing a large-scale map. We developed in this article a novel method called unidirectional growth (UG) to help solve this problem. The UG algorithm sequentially constructs the linkage map on the basis of novel results about additive distance. It not only is fast but also has a very high accuracy in recovering the true order of loci according to our simulation studies. Since the UG method requires n {\`A} 1 cycles to estimate the ordering of n loci, it is particularly useful for estimating linkage maps consisting of hundreds or even thousands of linked codominant loci on a chromosome.},

Although the rate of crossovers is often used for genetic mapping, the gene conversion events are not well studied especially in outbred species, which could produce distorted markers and thus affect the precision of genetic maps. Results: We proposed a strategy for identifying gene conversion events in Populus with the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from the two parents and their progeny in an F1 hybrid population. The strategy first involved phasing the heterozygous SNPs of the parents to obtain the parental haplotype blocks by NGS analytical tools, permitting to identify the parental gene conversion events with progeny genotypes. By incorporating available genetic linkage maps, longer haplotype blocks each corresponding to a chromosome can be created, not only allowing to detect crossover events but also possibly to locate a crossover in a small region. Our analysis revealed that gene conversions are more abundant than crossovers in Populus, with a higher probability to generate distorted markers in the regions involved than in the other regions on genome. The analytical procedures were implemented with Perl scripts as a freely available package, findGCO at https://github.com/tongchf/findGCO. Conclusions: The novel strategy and the new developed Perl package permit to identify gene conversion events with the next-generation sequencing technology in a hybrid population of outbred species. The new method revealed that in a genetic mapping population some distorted genetic markers are possibly due to the gene conversion events.},

  abstract = {Meiotic chromosomes in human oocytes are packaged differently than in spermatocytes at the pachytene stage of meiosis I, when crossing-over takes place. Thus the meiosis-specific pairing structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC), is considerably longer in oocytes in comparison to spermatocytes. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of this length factor on meiotic recombination in male and female human germ cells. The positions of crossovers were identified by the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1. Spermatocytes have approximately 50 crossovers per cell in comparison to more than 70 in oocytes. Analyses of inter-crossover distances (and presumptively crossover interference) along SCs suggested that while there might be inter-individual variation, there was no consistent difference between sexes. Thus the higher rate of recombination in human oocytes is not a consequence of more closely spaced crossovers along the SCs. The rate of recombination per unit length of SC is higher in spermatocytes than oocytes. However, when the so-called obligate chiasma is excluded from the analysis, then the rates of recombination per unit length of SC are essentially identical in the two sexes. Our analyses indicate that the inter-sex difference in recombination is largely a consequence of the difference in meiotic chromosome architecture in the two sexes. We propose that SC length per se, and therefore the size of the physical platform for crossing-over (and not the DNA content) is the principal factor determining the difference in rate of recombination in male and female germ cells. A preliminary investigation of SC loop size by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated loops may be shorter in oocytes than in spermatocytes.},

We analyzed genomic and phenotypic data of 1254 hybrids of a typical maize hybrid breeding program based on the important Dent {\texttimes} Flint heterotic pattern. Our main objectives were to investigate genome properties of the parental lines (e.g., allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, and phases) and examine the prospects of genomic prediction of hybrid performance. We found high consistency of linkage phases and large differences in allele frequencies between the Dent and Flint heterotic groups in pericentromeric regions. These results can be explained by the Hill{\textendash}Robertson effect and support the hypothesis of differential fixation of alleles due to pseudo-overdominance in these regions. In pericentromeric regions we also found indications for consistent marker{\textendash}QTL linkage between heterotic groups. With prediction methods GBLUP and BayesB, the cross-validation prediction accuracy ranged from 0.75 to 0.92 for grain yield and from 0.59 to 0.95 for grain moisture. The prediction accuracy of untested hybrids was highest, if both parents were parents of other hybrids in the training set, and lowest, if none of them were involved in any training set hybrid. Optimizing the composition of the training set in terms of number of lines and hybrids per line could further increase prediction accuracy. We conclude that genomic prediction facilitates a paradigm shift in hybrid breeding by focusing on the performance of experimental hybrids rather than the performance of parental lines in testcrosses.},

Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Grapevine is one of the most relevant fruit crops in the world. Deeper genetic knowledge could assist modern grapevine breeding programs to develop new wine grape varieties able to face climate change effects. To assist in the rapid identification of markers for crop yield components, grape quality traits and adaptation potential, we generated a large Vitis vinifera L. population (N\,=\,624) by crossing five red wine cultivars in a half-diallel scheme, which was subsequently sequenced by an efficient GBS procedure. A high number of fully informative genetic variants was detected using a novel mapping approach capable of reconstructing local haplotypes from adjacent biallelic SNPs, which were subsequently used to construct the densest consensus genetic map available for the cultivated grapevine to date. This 1378.3-cM map integrates 10 bi-parental consensus maps and orders 4437 markers in 3353 unique positions on 19 chromosomes. Markers are well distributed all along the grapevine reference genome, covering up to 98.8\% of its genomic sequence. Additionally, a good agreement was observed between genetic and physical orders, adding confidence in the quality of this map. Collectively, our results pave the way for future genetic studies (such as fine QTL mapping) aimed to understand the complex relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation in the cultivated grapevine. In addition, the method used (which efficiently delivers a high number of fully informative markers) could be of interest to other outbred organisms, notably perennial fruit crops.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, recombination ensures allelic exchanges through crossovers (COs) between the homologous chromosomes. Advances in our understanding of the rules of COs have come from studies of mutations including structural chromosomal rearrangements that, when heterozygous, are known to impair COs in various organisms. In this work, we investigate the effect of a large heterozygous pericentric inversion on male and female recombination in Arabidopsis. The inversion was discovered in the Atmcc1 mutant background and was characterized through genetic and next-generation sequencing analysis. Reciprocal backcross populations, each consisting of over 400 individuals, obtained from the mutant and the wild type, both crossed with Landsberg erecta, were analyzed genome-wide by 143 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The negative impact of inversion became evident in terms of CO loss in the rearranged chromosome in both male and female meiosis. No single-CO event was detected within the inversion, consistent with a postmeiotic selection operating against unbalanced gametes. Cytological analysis of chiasmata in F1 plants confirmed that COs were reduced in male meiosis in the chromosome with inversion. Crossover suppression on the rearranged chromosome is associated with a significant increase of COs in the other chromosomes, thereby maintaining unchanged the number of COs per cell. The CO pattern observed in our study is consistent with the interchromosomal (IC) effect as first described in Drosophila. In contrast to male meiosis, in female meiosis no IC effect is visible. This may be related to the greater strength of interference that constrains the CO number in excess of the minimum value imposed by CO assurance in Arabidopsis female meiosis.},

A further, new model for chromatid interference is presented here. In contrast to the existing model, it is assumed that chromatid interference acts only in the neighborhood of a chiasma. The appropriateness of this model is demonstrated by its application to three sets of recombination data.

Interference does not necessarily act homogeneously. After extending both models to allow for heterogeneity of chromatid interference, a further improvement in fit was achieved.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Goat populations that are characterized within the AdaptMap project cover a large part of the world-wide distribution of this species and provide the opportunity to assess their diversity at a global scale. We analysed genome-wide 50 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 144 populations to describe the global patterns of molecular variation, compare them to those observed in other livestock species, and identify the drivers that led to the current distribution of goats. Results:\hspace{0.6em} A high degree of genetic variability exists among the goat populations studied. Our results highlight a strong partitioning of molecular diversity between and within continents. Three major gene pools correspond to goats from Europe, Africa and West Asia. Dissection of sub-structures disclosed regional gene pools, which reflect the main post-domestication migration routes. We also identified several exchanges, mainly in African populations, and which often involve admixed and cosmopolitan breeds. Extensive gene flow has taken place within specific areas (e.g., south Europe, Morocco and Mali-Burkina Faso-Nigeria), whereas elsewhere isolation due to geographical barriers (e.g., seas or mountains) or human management has decreased local gene flows. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} After domestication in the Fertile Crescent in the early Neolithic era (ca. 12,000 YBP), domestic goats that already carried differentiated gene pools spread to Europe, Africa and Asia. The spread of these populations determined the major genomic background of the continental populations, which currently have a more marked subdivision than that observed in other ruminant livestock species. Subsequently, further diversification occurred at the regional level due to geographical and reproductive isolation, which was accompanied by additional migra-tions and/or importations, the traces of which are still detectable today. The effects of breed formation were clearly detected, particularly in Central and North Europe. Overall, our results highlight a remarkable diversity that occurs at the global scale and is locally partitioned and often affected by introgression from cosmopolitan breeds. These find-ings support the importance of long-term preservation of goat diversity, and provide a useful framework for investi-gating adaptive introgression, directing genetic improvement and choosing breeding targets.},

A BAC-library comprising 55,680 clones was constructed and 46,270 BESs were generated. Mining of these BESs provided 6,845 SSRs, and primer pairs were designed for 1,344 SSRs. In parallel, DArT arrays with ca. 15,000 clones were developed, and 5,397 clones were found polymorphic among 94 genotypes tested. Screening of newly developed BES-SSR markers and DArT arrays on the parental genotypes of the RIL mapping population showed polymorphism with 253 BES-SSR markers and 675 DArT markers. Segregation data obtained for these polymorphic markers and 494 markers data compiled from published reports or collaborators were used for constructing the genetic map. As a result, a comprehensive genetic map comprising 1,291 markers on eight linkage groups (LGs) spanning a total of 845.56 cM distance was developed (http://cmap.icrisat.ac.in/cmap/sm/cp/thudi/). The number of markers per linkage group ranged from 68 (LG 8) to 218 (LG 3) with an average inter-marker distance of 0.65 cM. While the developed resource of molecular markers will be useful for genetic diversity, genetic mapping and molecular breeding applications, the comprehensive genetic map with integrated BES-SSR markers will facilitate its anchoring to the physical map (under construction) to accelerate map-based cloning of genes in chickpea and comparative genome evolution studies in legumes.},

  abstract = {In flowering plants, the accumulation of small deletions through unequal homologous recombination (UR) and illegitimate recombination (IR) is proposed to be the major process counteracting genome expansion, which is caused primarily by the periodic amplification of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs). However, the full suite of evolutionary forces that govern the gain or loss of transposable elements (TEs) and their distribution within a genome remains unclear. Here, we investigated the distribution and structural variation of LTR-RTs in relation to the rates of local genetic recombination (GR) and gene densities in the rice (               Oryza sativa               ) genome. Our data revealed a positive correlation between GR rates and gene densities and negative correlations between LTR-RT densities and both GR and gene densities. The data also indicate a tendency for LTR-RT elements and fragments to be shorter in regions with higher GR rates; the size reduction of LTR-RTs appears to be achieved primarily through solo LTR formation by UR. Comparison of               indica               and               japonica               rice revealed patterns and frequencies of LTR-RT gain and loss within different evolutionary timeframes. Different LTR-RT families exhibited variable distribution patterns and structural changes, but overall LTR-RT compositions and genes were organized according to the GR gradients of the genome. Further investigation of non-LTR-RTs and DNA transposons revealed a negative correlation between gene densities and the abundance of DNA transposons and a weak correlation between GR rates and the abundance of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs)/short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Together, these observations suggest that GR and gene density play important roles in shaping the dynamic structure of the rice genome.},

  abstract = {Background: Although homologous recombination affects the efficacy of selection in populations, the pattern of recombination rate evolution and its effects on genome evolution across plants are largely unknown. Recombination can reduce genome size by enabling the removal of LTR retrotransposons, alter codon usage by GC biased gene conversion, contribute to complex histories of gene duplication and loss through tandem duplication, and enhance purifying selection on genes. Therefore, variation in recombination rate across species may explain some of the variation in genomic architecture as well as rates of molecular evolution. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the evolution of global meiotic recombination rate in angiosperms and its effects on genome architecture and selection at the molecular level using genetic maps and genome sequences from thirty angiosperm species. Results: Recombination rate is negatively correlated with genome size, which is likely caused by the removal of LTR retrotransposons.

This suggests a role for recombination in the preservation of duplicate genes or expansion of gene families. An analysis of the correlation between the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) and recombination rate in 3748 genes indicates that higher recombination rates are associated with an increased efficacy of purifying selection, suggesting that global recombination rates affect variation in rates of molecular evolution across distantly related angiosperm species, not just between populations. We also identified shifts in dN/dS for recombination proteins that are associated with shifts in global recombination rate across our sample of angiosperms. Conclusions: Although our analyses only reveal correlations, not mechanisms, and do not include potential covariates of recombination rate, like effective population size, they suggest that global recombination rates may play an important role in shaping the macroevolutionary patterns of gene and genome evolution in plants.

These sequencing methods are increasingly being utilized in population genetic studies across a diverse range of species. Two side-effects of these methods, however, are (1) sequencing errors and (2) heterozygous genotypes called as homozygous due to only one allele at a particular locus being sequenced, which occurs when the sequencing depth is insufficient. Both of these errors have a profound effect on the estimation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and, if not taken into account, lead to inaccurate estimates. We developed a new likelihood method, GUS-LD, to estimate pairwise linkage disequilibrium using low coverage sequencing data that accounts for undercalled heterozygous genotypes and sequencing errors. Our findings show that accurate estimates were obtained using GUS-LD, whereas underestimation of LD results if no adjustment is made for the errors.},

  abstract = {Background: The commercial oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) produces a mesocarp oil (commonly called `palm oil') with approximately equal proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (FAs). An increase in unsaturated FAs content or iodine value (IV) as a measure of the degree of unsaturation would help to open up new markets for the oil. One way to manipulate the fatty acid composition (FAC) in palm oil is through introgression of favourable alleles from the American oil palm, E. oleifera, which has a more unsaturated oil. Results: In this study, a segregating E. oleifera x E. guineensis (OxG) hybrid population for FAC is used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to IV and various FAs. QTL analysis revealed 10 major and two putative QTLs for IV and six FAs, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1 and C18:2 distributed across six linkage groups (LGs), OT1, T2, T3, OT4, OT6 and T9. The major QTLs for IV and C16:0 on LGOT1 explained 60.0 {\textendash} 69.0 \% of the phenotypic trait variation and were validated in two independent BC2 populations. The genomic interval contains several key structural genes in the FA and oil biosynthesis pathways such as PATE/FATB, HIBCH, BASS2, LACS4 and DGAT1 and also a relevant transcription factor (TF), WRI1. The literature suggests that some of these genes can exhibit pleiotropic effects in the regulatory networks of these traits. Using the whole genome sequence data, markers tightly linked to the candidate genes were also developed. Clustering trait values according to the allelic forms of these candidate markers revealed significant differences in the IV and FAs of the palms in the mapping and validation crosses. Conclusions: The candidate gene approach described and exploited here is useful to identify the potential causal genes linked to FAC and can be adopted for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in oil palm.},

We find strong and significant associations between the positions of candidate genes and QTL that affect heading date, as well as those that influence the concentrations of oil and {$\beta$}-glucan in the grain. We examine genome-wide recombination profiles to confirm the presence of a large, unbalanced translocation from chromosome 1\,C to 1\,A, and a possible inversion on chromosome 7D. Such chromosome rearrangements appear to be common in oat, where they cause pseudo-linkage and recombination suppression, affecting the segregation, localization, and deployment of QTLs in breeding programs.},

  abstract = {The hexaploid bread wheat genome comprises over 16 gigabases of sequence across 21 chromosomes. Meiotic crossovers are highly polarized along the chromosomes, with elevation in the gene-dense distal regions and suppression in the               Gypsy               retrotransposon-dense centromere-proximal regions. We profiled the genomic landscapes of the meiotic recombinase DMC1 and the chromosome axis protein ASY1 in wheat and investigated their relationships with crossovers, chromatin state, and genetic diversity. DMC1 and ASY1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed strong co-enrichment in the distal, crossover-active regions of the wheat chromosomes. Distal ChIP-seq enrichment is consistent with spatiotemporally biased cytological immunolocalization of DMC1 and ASY1 close to the telomeres during meiotic prophase I. DMC1 and ASY1 ChIP-seq peaks show significant overlap with genes and transposable elements in the               Mariner               and               Mutator               superfamilies. However, DMC1 and ASY1 ChIP-seq peaks were detected along the length of each chromosome, including in low-crossover regions. At the fine scale, crossover elevation at DMC1 and ASY1 peaks and genes correlates with enrichment of the Polycomb histone modification H3K27me3. This indicates a role for facultative heterochromatin, coincident with high DMC1 and ASY1, in promoting crossovers in wheat and is reflected in distalized H3K27me3 enrichment observed via ChIP-seq and immunocytology. Genes with elevated crossover rates and high DMC1 and ASY1 ChIP-seq signals are overrepresented for defense-response and immunity annotations, have higher sequence polymorphism, and exhibit signatures of selection. Our findings are consistent with meiotic recombination promoting genetic diversity, shaping host{\textendash}pathogen co-evolution, and accelerating adaptation by increasing the efficiency of selection.},

  abstract = {Homologous chromosomes must pair and recombine to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis, a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing eukaryotes. Meiotic recombination initiates by programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the conserved type II topoisomerase-like enzyme SPO11. A subset of meiotic DSBs are resolved as crossovers, whereby reciprocal exchange of DNA occurs between homologous chromosomes. Importantly, DSBs are non-randomly distributed along eukaryotic chromosomes, forming preferentially in permissive regions known as hotspots. In many species, including plants, DSB hotspots are located within nucleosome-depleted regions. DSB localization is governed by interconnected factors, including cis-regulatory elements, transcription factor binding, and chromatin accessibility, as well as by higher-order chromosome architecture. The spatiotemporal control of DSB formation occurs within a specialized chromosomal structure characterized by sister chromatids organized into linear arrays of chromatin loops that are anchored to a proteinaceous axis. Although SPO11 and its partner proteins required for DSB formation are bound to the axis, DSBs occur preferentially within the chromatin loops, which supports the ``tethered-loop/axis model'' for meiotic recombination. In this mini review, we discuss insights gained from recent efforts to define and profile DSB hotspots at high resolution in eukaryotic genomes. These advances are deepening our understanding of how meiotic recombination shapes genetic diversity and genome evolution in diverse species.},

  abstract = {Homologous chromosomes must pair and recombine to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis, a specialized type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing eukaryotes. Meiotic recombination initiates by programmed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the conserved type II topoisomerase-like enzyme SPO11. A subset of meiotic DSBs are resolved as crossovers, whereby reciprocal exchange of DNA occurs between homologous chromosomes. Importantly, DSBs are non-randomly distributed along eukaryotic chromosomes, forming preferentially in permissive regions known as hotspots. In many species, including plants, DSB hotspots are located within nucleosome-depleted regions. DSB localization is governed by interconnected factors, including cis-regulatory elements, transcription factor binding, and chromatin accessibility, as well as by higher-order chromosome architecture. The spatiotemporal control of DSB formation occurs within a specialized chromosomal structure characterized by sister chromatids organized into linear arrays of chromatin loops that are anchored to a proteinaceous axis. Although SPO11 and its partner proteins required for DSB formation are bound to the axis, DSBs occur preferentially within the chromatin loops, which supports the ``tethered-loop/axis model'' for meiotic recombination. In this mini review, we discuss insights gained from recent efforts to define and profile DSB hotspots at high resolution in eukaryotic genomes. These advances are deepening our understanding of how meiotic recombination shapes genetic diversity and genome evolution in diverse species.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Functional mapping that embeds the developmental mechanisms of complex traits shows great power to study the dynamic pattern of genetic effects triggered by individual quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A full-sib family, produced by crossing two heterozygous parents, is characteristic of uncertainties about crosstype at a locus and linkage phase between different loci. Integrating functional mapping into a full-sib family requires a model selection procedure capable of addressing these uncertainties. 3FunMap, written in VC++ 6.0, provides a flexible and extensible platform to perform full-sib functional mapping of dynamic traits. Functions in the package encompass linkage phase determination, marker map construction and the pattern identification of QTL segregation, dynamic tests of QTL effects, permutation tests and numerical simulation. We demonstrate the features of 3FunMap through real data analysis and computer simulation.},

As an allopolyploid species, tobacco harbors a massive and complex genome, which makes the application of molecular markers complicated and challenging. In our study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of an intraspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, a F1 generation and their parents. With the Nicotiana tabacum (K326 cultivar) genome as reference, a total of 45,081 markers were characterized to construct the genetic map, which spanned a genetic distance of 3486.78 cM. Evaluation of a two-dimensional heat map proved the high quality of the genetic map. We utilized these markers to anchor scaffolds and analyzed the ancestral genome origin of linkage groups (LGs). Furthermore, such a high-density genetic map will be applied for quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection, gene localization, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and marker-assisted breeding in tobacco.},

Two parent-specific linkage maps were constructed with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data from an F1 hybrid population derived from Populus deltoides and Populus simonii, and applied in QTL mapping and genome assembly. The female P. deltoides map contained 4018 SNPs, which were divided into 19 linkage groups under a wide range of LOD thresholds from 7 to 55. The male P. simonii map showed similar characteristics, consisting of 2097 SNPs, which also belonged to 19 linkage groups under LOD thresholds of 7 to 29. The SNP order of each linkage group was optimal among different ordering results from several available software. Moreover, the linkage maps allowed the detection of 39 QTLs underlying tree height and 47 for diameter at breast height. In addition, the linkage maps improved the anchoring of 689 contigs of P. simonii to chromosomes. The 2 parental genetic maps of Populus are of high quality, especially in terms of SNP data quality, the SNP order within linkage groups, and the perfect match between the number of linkage groups and the karyotype of Populus, as well as the excellent performances in QTL mapping and genome assembly. Both approaches for extracting and ordering SNPs could be applied to other species for constructing high-quality genetic maps.},

A high-density linkage map is an essential tool for further fine-mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a variety of traits in the pig and for a better understanding of mechanisms underlying genome evolution. Results: Four different pig pedigrees were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip. Recombination maps for the autosomes were computed for each individual pedigree using a common set of markers. The resulting genetic maps comprised 38,599 SNPs, including 928 SNPs not positioned on a chromosome in the current assembly of the pig genome (build 10.2). The total genetic length varied according to the pedigree, from 1797 to 2149 cM. Female maps were longer than male maps, with a notable exception for SSC1 where male maps are characterized by a higher recombination rate than females in the region between 91{\textendash}250 Mb. The recombination rates varied among chromosomes and along individual chromosomes, regions with high recombination rates tending to cluster close to the chromosome ends, irrespective of the position of the centromere. Correlations between main sequence features and recombination rates were investigated and significant correlations were obtained for all the studied motifs. Regions characterized by high recombination rates were enriched for specific GC-rich sequence motifs as compared to low recombinant regions. These correlations were higher in females than in males, and females were found to be more recombinant than males at regions where the GC content was greater than 0.4. Conclusions: The analysis of the recombination rate along the pig genome highlighted that the regions exhibiting higher levels of recombination tend to cluster around the ends of the chromosomes irrespective of the location of the centromere. Major sex-differences in recombination were observed: females had a higher recombination rate within GC-rich regions and exhibited a stronger correlation between recombination rates and specific sequence features.},

Here we present the first genomic view of a reciprocal translocation that causes two physically unconnected pairs of chromosomes to be coinherited as sex chromosomes. In a population of the common frog (Rana temporaria), both pairs of X and Y chromosomes show extensive sequence differentiation, but not degeneration of the Y chromosomes. A new method based on gene trees shows both chromosomes are sex-linked. Furthermore, the gene trees from the two Y chromosomes have identical topologies, showing they have been coinherited since the reciprocal translocation occurred. Reciprocal translocations can thus reshape sex linkage on a much greater scale compared with inversions, the type of rearrangement that is much better known in sex chromosome evolution, and they can greatly amplify the power of sexually antagonistic selection to drive genomic rearrangement. Two more populations show evidence of other rearrangements, suggesting that this species has unprecedented structural polymorphism in its sex chromosomes.},

Particularly, application of modern breeding requires high-density linkage maps that are integrated into a highly contiguous reference genome. Here, we present a rapid method for deriving haplotypes and developing linkage maps, and its application to Mentha suaveolens, one of the diploid progenitors of cultivated mints. Using sequence-capture via DNA hybridization to target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we successfully genotyped {$\sim$}5000 SNPs within the genome of \&gt;400 individuals derived from a self cross. After stringent quality control, and identification of nonredundant SNPs, 1919 informative SNPs were retained for linkage map construction. The resulting linkage map defined a total genetic space of 942.17 cM divided among 12 linkage groups, ranging from 56.32 to 122.61 cM in length. The linkage map is in good agreement with pseudomolecules from our preliminary genome assembly, proving this resource effective for the correction and validation of the reference genome. We discuss the advantages of this method for the rapid creation of linkage maps.},

  abstract = {Most cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the inherited inability to synthesize cortisol, are caused by mutations in the steroid 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21). Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95\% of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination between a normally active gene (CYP21) and a linked pseudogene (CYP21P). Approximately 20\% of mutant alleles carry DNA deletions of 30 kb that have presumably been generated by unequal meiotic crossing-over, whereas 75\% carry one or more mutations in CYP21 that are normally found in the CYP21P pseudogene. These latter mutations are termed "gene conversions," although the mechanism by which they are generated is not well understood. To assess the frequency at which these different recombination events occur, we have used PCR to detect de novo deletions and gene conversions in matched sperm and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA samples from normal individuals. Deletions with breakpoints in a 100-bp region in intron 2 and exon 3 were detected in sperm DNA samples with frequencies of approximately 1 in 10(5)-10(6) genomes but were never detected in the matching leukocyte DNA. Gene conversions in the same region occur in approximately 1 in 10(3)-10(5) genomes in both sperm and leukocyte DNA. These data suggest that whereas deletions occur exclusively in meiosis, gene conversions occur during both meiosis and mitosis, or perhaps only during mitosis. Thus, gene conversions must occur by a mechanism distinct from unequal crossing-over.},

  abstract = {High-density linkage maps are vital to supporting the correct placement of scaffolds and gene sequences on chromosomes and fundamental to contemporary organismal research and scientific approaches to genetic improvement, especially in paleopolyploids with exceptionally complex genomes, eg, upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., ``2n\,=\,52''). Three independently developed intraspecific upland mapping populations were analyzed to generate 3 high-density genetic linkage single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps and a consensus map using the CottonSNP63K array. The populations consisted of a previously reported F2, a recombinant inbred line (RIL), and reciprocal RIL population, from ``Phytogen 72'' and ``Stoneville 474'' cultivars. The cluster file provided 7417 genotyped SNP markers, resulting in 26 linkage groups corresponding to the 26 chromosomes (c) of the allotetraploid upland cotton (AD)1 arisen from the merging of 2 genomes (``A'' Old World and ``D'' New World). Patterns of chromosome-specific recombination were largely consistent across mapping populations. The highdensity genetic consensus map included 7244 SNP markers that spanned 3538\,cM and comprised 3824 SNP bins, of which 1783 and 2041 were in the At and Dt subgenomes with 1825 and 1713\,cM map lengths, respectively. Subgenome average distances were nearly identical, indicating that subgenomic differences in bin number arose due to the high numbers of SNPs on the Dt subgenome. Examination of expected recombination frequency or crossovers (COs) on the chromosomes within each population of the 2 subgenomes revealed that COs were also not affected by the SNPs or SNP bin number in these subgenomes. Comparative alignment analyses identified historical ancestral Atsubgenomic translocations of c02 and c03, as well as of c04 and c05. The consensus map SNP sequences aligned with high congruency to the NBI assembly of Gossypium hirsutum. However, the genomic comparisons revealed evidence of additional unconfirmed possible duplications, inversions and translocations, and unbalance SNP sequence homology or SNP sequence/loci genomic dominance, or homeolog loci bias of the upland tetraploid At and Dt subgenomes. The alignments indicated that 364 SNP-associated previously unintegrated scaffolds can be placed in pseudochromosomes of the NBI G hirsutum assembly. This is the first intraspecific SNP genetic linkage consensus map assembled in G hirsutum with a core of reproducible mendelian SNP markers assayed on different populations and it provides further knowledge of chromosome arrangement of genic and nongenic SNPs. Together, the consensus map and RIL populations provide a synergistically useful platform for localizing and identifying agronomically important loci for improvement of the cotton crop.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks are initiated by the topoisomerase-like enzyme SPO11 and are repaired by inter-sister chromatid and inter-homologue DNA repair pathways. Genome-wide maps of initiating DNA double-strand breaks and interhomologue repair events are now available for a number of mammalian, fungal and plant species. In mammals, PRDM9 specifies the location of meiotic recombination initiation via recognition of specific DNA sequence motifs by its C2H2 zinc finger array. In fungi and plants, meiotic recombination appears to be initiated less discriminately in accessible chromatin, including at gene promoters. Generally, meiotic crossover is suppressed in highly repetitive genomic regions that are made up of transposable elements (TEs), to prevent deleterious non-allelic homologous recombination events. However, recent and older studies have revealed intriguing relationships between meiotic recombination initiation and repair, and transposable elements. For instance, gene conversion events have been detected in maize centromeric retroelements, mouse MULE-MuDR DNA transposons undergo substantial meiotic recombination initiation, Arabidopsis Helitron TEs are among the hottest of recombination initiation hotspots, and human TE sequences can modify the crossover rate at adjacent PRDM9 motifs in cis. Here, we summarize the relationship between meiotic recombination and TEs, discuss recent insights from highly divergent eukaryotes and highlight outstanding questions in the field.},

Repeat expansions are dynamic, and disease inheritance and progression are influenced by the size and the rate of expansion. Thus, an understanding of the various cellular mechanisms that cooperate to control or promote repeat expansions is of interest to human health. In addition, the study of repeat expansion and contraction mechanisms has provided insight into how repair pathways operate in the context of structure-forming DNA, as well as insights into non-canonical roles for repair proteins. Here we review the mechanisms of repeat instability, with a special emphasis on the knowledge gained from the various model systems that have been developed to study this topic. We cover the repair pathways and proteins that operate to maintain genome stability, or in some cases cause instability, and the cross-talk and interactions between them.},

However, the extent to which TEs affect gene expression variation on a genome-wide scale in comparison with other types of variants is still unclear. We characterized TE insertion polymorphisms and their association with gene expression in 124 whole-genome sequences from a single population of Capsella grandiflora, and contrasted this with the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Population frequency of insertions was negatively correlated with distance to genes, as well as density of conserved noncoding elements, suggesting that the negative effects of TEs on gene regulation are important in limiting their abundance. Rare TE variants strongly influence gene expression variation, predominantly through downregulation. In contrast, rare SNPs contribute equally to up- and down-regulation, but have a weaker individual effect than TEs. An expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis shows that a greater proportion of common TEs are eQTLs as opposed to common SNPs, and a third of the genes with TE eQTLs do not have SNP eQTLs. In contrast with rare TE insertions, common insertions are more likely to increase expression, consistent with recent models of cis-regulatory evolution favoring enhancer alleles. Taken together, these results imply that TEs are a significant contributor to gene expression variation and are individually more likely than rare SNPs to cause extreme changes in gene expression.},

In this review, we discuss various recombination inference methods, and the strengths and weaknesses of these methods in analyzing recombination in African-descent populations. Furthermore, we provide a decision tree and recommendations for which inference method to use in various research contexts. Establishing an appropriate methodology for recombination rate inference in a particular study will improve the accuracy of various downstream analyses including but not limited to local ancestry inference, haplotype phasing, fine-mapping of GWAS loci and genome assemblies.},

  abstract = {An ultradense genetic linkage map with .10,000 AFLP loci was constructed from a heterozygous diploid potato population. To our knowledge, this is the densest meiotic recombination map ever constructed. A fast marker-ordering algorithm was used, based on the minimization of the total number of recombination events within a given marker order in combination with genotyping error-detection software. This resulted in ``skeleton bin maps,'' which can be viewed as the most parsimonious marker order. The unit of distance is not expressed in centimorgans but in ``bins.'' A bin is a position on the genetic map with a unique segregation pattern that is separated from adjacent bins by a single recombination event. Putative centromeres were identified by a strong clustering of markers, probably due to cold spots for recombination. Conversely, recombination hot spots resulted in large intervals of up to 15 cM without markers. The current level of marker saturation suggests that marker density is proportional to physical distance and independent of recombination frequency. Most chromatids (92\%) recombined once or never, suggesting strong chiasma interference. Absolute chiasma interference within a chromosome arm could not be demonstrated. Two examples of contig construction and map-based cloning have demonstrated that the marker spacing was in accordance with the expected physical distance: approximately one marker per BAC length. Currently, the markers are used for genetic anchoring of a physical map of potato to deliver a sequence-ready minimal tiling path of BAC contigs of specific chromosomal regions for the potato genome sequencing consortium (http://www.potatogenome.net).},

Since the criterion we propose does not require intensive calculations, the algorithm rapidly produces an optimal ordering as well as a series of near-optimal ones. The latter provides insight into the local certainty of ordering along the map. A simulation study was performed to compare the performance of RECORD and JoinMap. RECORD is much faster and less sensitive to missing observations and scoring errors, since the optimisation criterion is less dependent on the position of the erroneous markers. In particular, RECORD performs better in regions of the map with high marker density. The implications of high marker densities on linkage map construction are discussed.},

To gain further insight from this data set, we develop a birth{\textendash}death{\textendash}diversification model for mobile genetic elements subject to sequence diversification; applying the model to PMPs we are able to quantify the relative importance of duplication, loss, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and diversification to the maintenance of the PMP reservoir. The model predicts low rates of HGT relative to the duplication and loss of PMP copies, rapid dynamics of PMP families, and a pool of PMPs that exist as a single copy in a genome at any given time, despite their mobility. We report evidence of these ``singletons'' at high frequencies in prokaryotic genomes. We also demonstrate that including selection, either for or against PMPs, was not necessary to describe the observed data.},

  abstract = {Centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Despite extensive research, centromere locations in yeast genomes remain difficult to infer, and in most species they are still unknown. Recently, the chromatin conformation capture assay, HiC, has been re-purposed for diverse applications, including de novo genome assembly, deconvolution of metagenomic samples and inference of centromere locations. We describe a method, Centurion, that jointly infers the locations of all centromeres in a single genome from Hi-C data by exploiting the centromeres' tendency to cluster in three-dimensional space. We first demonstrate the accuracy of Centurion in identifying known centromere locations from high coverage Hi-C data of budding yeast and a human malaria parasite. We then use Centurion to infer centromere locations in 14 yeast species. Across all microbes that we consider, Centurion predicts 89\% of centromeres within 5 kb of their known locations. We also demonstrate the robustness of the approach in datasets with low sequencing depth. Finally, we predict centromere coordinates for six yeast species that currently lack centromere annotations. These results show that Centurion can be used for centromere identification for diverse species of yeast and possibly other microorganisms.},

So far, few chickpea~(               Cicer               arietinum               ) germplasm accessions have been characterized at the genome sequence level               2               . Here we present a detailed map of variation in 3,171 cultivated and 195 wild accessions to provide publicly available resources for chickpea genomics research and breeding. We constructed a chickpea pan-genome to describe genomic diversity across cultivated chickpea and its wild progenitor accessions. A divergence tree using genes present in around 80\% of individuals in one species allowed us to estimate the divergence of               Cicer               over the last 21\,million years. Our analysis found chromosomal segments and genes that show signatures of selection during domestication, migration and improvement. The chromosomal locations of deleterious mutations responsible for limited genetic diversity and decreased fitness were identified in elite germplasm. We identified superior haplotypes for improvement-related traits in landraces that can be introgressed into elite breeding lines through haplotype-based breeding, and found targets for purging deleterious alleles through genomics-assisted breeding and/or gene editing. Finally, we propose three crop breeding strategies based on genomic prediction to enhance crop productivity for 16 traits while avoiding the erosion of genetic diversity through optimal contribution selection (OCS)-based pre-breeding. The predicted performance for 100-seed weight, an important yield-related trait, increased by up to 23\% and 12\% with OCS- and haplotype-based genomic approaches, respectively.},

  abstract = {DNA introgressed from one species into another is typically deleterious at many genomic loci in the recipient species. It is therefore purged by selection over time. Here, we use mathematical modeling and whole-genome simulations to study the influence of recombination on the purging of introgressed DNA. We find that aggregate recombination controls the genome-wide rate of purging in the first few generations after admixture, when purging is most rapid. Aggregate recombination is quantified by r{\textasciimacron}, the average recombination rate across all locus pairs, and analogous metrics. It is influenced by the number of crossovers (i.e., the map length) and their locations along chromosomes, and by the number of chromosomes and heterogeneity in their size. A comparative prediction of our analysis is that species with fewer chromosomes should purge introgressed DNA more profoundly, and therefore should exhibit a weaker genomic signal of historical introgression. With regard to patterns across the genome, we show that, in heterogametic species with autosomal recombination in both sexes, more purging is expected on sex chromosomes than on autosomes, all else equal. The opposite prediction holds for species without autosomal recombination in the heterogametic sex. Finally, we show that positive genomic correlations between local recombination rate and introgressed ancestry, as recently observed in several taxa, are likely driven not by recombination's effect in unlinking neutral from deleterious introgressed alleles, but rather by its effect on the rate of purging of the deleterious alleles themselves.},

Traditional measures, such as map length, crossover frequency, and the recombination index, are not influenced by the positions of crossovers along chromosomes. Intuitively, though, a crossover in the middle of a chromosome causes more recombination than a crossover at the tip. Similarly, two crossovers very close to each other cause less recombination than if they were evenly spaced. Here, we study a measure of total recombination that does account for crossover position: average r, the probability that a random pair of loci recombines in the production of a gamete. Consistent with intuition, average r is larger when crossovers are more evenly spaced. We show that average r can be decomposed into distinct components deriving from intra-chromosomal recombination (crossing over) and inter-chromosomal recombination (independent assortment of chromosomes), allowing separate analysis of these components. Average r can be calculated given knowledge of crossover positions either at meiosis I or in gametes/offspring. Technological advances in cytology and sequencing over the past two decades make calculation of average r possible, and we demonstrate its calculation for male and female humans using both kinds of data.},

  abstract = {Comparative studies in evolutionary genetics rely critically on evaluation of the total amount of genetic shuffling that occurs during gamete production. Such studies have been hampered by the absence of a direct measure of this quantity. Existing measures consider crossing-over by simply counting the average number of crossovers per meiosis. This is qualitatively inadequate, because the positions of crossovers along a chromosome are also critical: a crossover toward the middle of a chromosome causes more shuffling than a crossover toward the tip. Moreover, traditional measures fail to consider shuffling from independent assortment of homologous chromosomes (Mendel's second law). Here, we present a rigorous measure of genome-wide shuffling that does not suffer from these limitations. We define the parameter                                                                                                                        r                                              {\textasciimacron}                                                                                       as the probability that the alleles at two randomly chosen loci are shuffled during gamete production. This measure can be decomposed into separate contributions from crossover number and position and from independent assortment. Intrinsic implications of this metric include the fact that                                                                                                                        r                                              {\textasciimacron}                                                                                       is larger when crossovers are more evenly spaced, which suggests a selective advantage of crossover interference.

This variation is important in many applications of genetics, including pedigree-based estimation of the genetic variance and heritability of traits, and estimation of pedigree relationships from sequence data. Here, we calculate the variance of genetic relatedness for general pedigree relationships, making no assumptions about the recombination process. For the specific relationships of grandparentgrandoffspring and siblings, the variance of genetic relatedness is a simple decreasing function of r{\textasciimacron}, the average proportion of locus pairs that recombine in meiosis. For general pedigree relationships, the variance of genetic relatedness is likewise the average of some function of pairwise recombination rates. Therefore, features of the aggregate recombination process that affect r{\textasciimacron} and analogs also affect variance in genetic relatedness. Such features include the number of chromosomes and heterogeneity in their size, and the number of crossovers and their location along chromosomes. Our calculations help to explain several recent observations about variance in genetic relatedness, including that it is reduced by crossover interference (which is known to increase r{\textasciimacron}). Our methods further allow us to calculate the neutral variance of ancestry among F2s in a hybrid cross, enabling precise statistical inference in F2-based tests for various kinds of selection.},

Here, we directly estimate contemporary crossover rates and, for the first-time, non-crossover rates in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) from four three-generation pedigrees comprising 32 individuals. We further compare these results to historical, demography-aware, linkage-disequilibrium-based recombination rate estimates. From paternal meioses in the pedigrees, 165 crossover events with a median resolution of 22.3\hspace{0.25em}kb were observed, corresponding to a male autosomal map length of 2357 cM {\textendash} approximately 15\% longer than an existing linkage map based on human microsatellite loci. In addition, 85 non-crossover events with a mean tract length of 155\hspace{0.25em}bp were identified {\textendash} similar to the tract lengths observed in the only other two primates in which non-crossovers have been studied to date, humans and baboons. Consistent with observations in other placental mammals with PRDM9-directed recombination, crossover (and to a lesser extent non-crossover) events in rhesus macaques clustered in intergenic regions and towards the chromosomal ends in males {\textendash} a pattern in broad agreement with the historical, sex-averaged recombination rate estimates \-{\textendash} and evidence of GC-biased gene conversion was observed at non-crossover sites.},

This paucity of data has resulted in limited resolution on questions related to the causes and consequences of rate variation between species and populations, the determinants of within-genome rate variation, as well as the general tempo of recombination rate evolution on this branch of the tree of life. In order to address these questions, it is thus necessary to begin broadening our phylogenetic sampling. We here provide the first fine-scale recombination maps for two species of spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovii and Sceloporus megalepidurus, which diverged at least 12 Mya. As might be expected from similarities in karyotype, population-scaled recombination landscapes are largely conserved on the broad-scale. At the same time, considerable variation exists at the fine-scale, highlighting the importance of incorporating species-specific recombination maps in future population genomic studies.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, crossover recombination is essential to link homologous chromosomes and drive faithful chromosome segregation. Crossover recombination is non-random across the genome, and centromere-proximal crossovers are associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, including Trisomy 21 in humans. Here, we identify the conserved Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore sub-complex as a major factor that minimizes potentially deleterious centromere-proximal crossovers in budding yeast. We uncover multi-layered suppression of pericentromeric recombination by the Ctf19 complex, operating across distinct chromosomal distances. The Ctf19 complex prevents meiotic DNA break formation, the initiating event of recombination, proximal to the centromere. The Ctf19 complex independently drives the enrichment of cohesin throughout the broader pericentromere to suppress crossovers, but not DNA breaks. This non-canonical role of the kinetochore in defining a chromosome domain that is refractory to crossovers adds a new layer of functionality by which the kinetochore prevents the incidence of chromosome segregation errors that generate aneuploid gametes.           ,              The cells of animals, plants and many other organisms store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus, packaged into structures called chromosomes. Most cells contain two copies of each chromosome {\textendash} one inherited from each parent. However, sex cells (such as egg cells and sperm cells) contain just one copy of every chromosome, so that when they fuse, the new cell that is formed contains the full set.             Sex cells form in a process called meiosis, where a cell containing two copies of every chromosome duplicates its genetic material and then divides to form four new cells, each of which contains one copy of each chromosome. During meiosis, different versions of the same chromosome are able to swap sections of their DNA in a process called crossover. However, if a crossover occurs in the wrong part of the chromosome, the chromosome copies may not segregate correctly during cell division. This can lead to the formation of sex cells that contain the wrong number of chromosome copies, which can cause developmental conditions such as Down's syndrome.             Crossovers tend not to occur at a region of the chromosomes called the centromere, which is where copies of the same chromosome from the same parent are joined together until it is time for them to separate. If a crossover does occur in this region, segregation problems are more likely to occur. However, exactly how crossovers are suppressed at centromeres is not understood.             Vincenten et al. examined crossover positioning in budding yeast cells, which are often used as a model to investigate processes such as cell division. This revealed that a protein complex called Ctf19 stops DNA breaks from occurring near the centromere, and so prevents crossovers. Ctf19 also promotes the enrichment of another protein complex called cohesin near centromeres. This does not prevent DNA breaks from occurring, but also prevents crossovers.             Identifying this role of the Ctf19 complex has paved the way for understanding exactly how DNA breaks are prevented near centromeres. This will allow researchers to determine the impact of misplaced crossovers on how chromosomes segregate into sex cells.},

However, large-scale epigenomic studies have been applied to very few plant species, and variability in methylation among specialized tissues and its relationship to gene expression is poorly understood.                                         Results                                We surveyed DNA methylation from seven distinct tissue types (vegetative bud, male inflorescence [catkin], female catkin, leaf, root, xylem, phloem) in the reference tree species black cottonwood (                 Populus trichocarpa)                 . Using 5-methyl-cytosine DNA immunoprecipitation followed by Illumina sequencing (MeDIP-seq), we mapped a total of 129,360,151 36- or 32-mer reads to the                 P. trichocarpa                 reference genome. We validated MeDIP-seq results by bisulfite sequencing, and compared methylation and gene expression using published microarray data. Qualitative DNA methylation differences among tissues were obvious on a chromosome scale. Methylated genes had lower expression than unmethylated genes, but genes with methylation in transcribed regions ("gene body methylation") had even lower expression than genes with promoter methylation. Promoter methylation was more frequent than gene body methylation in all tissues except male catkins. Male catkins differed in demethylation of particular transposable element categories, in level of gene body methylation, and in expression range of genes with methylated transcribed regions. Tissue-specific gene expression patterns were correlated with both gene body and promoter methylation.                                                        Conclusions               We found striking differences among tissues in methylation, which were apparent at the chromosomal scale and when genes and transposable elements were examined. In contrast to other studies in plants, gene body methylation had a more repressive effect on transcription than promoter methylation.},

The availability of complete genome sequences for two bird species, the chicken and the zebra finch, provides, for the first time, an ideal opportunity to analyze the relationship between structural genomic variation (chromosomal and CNV) and recombination on a genome-wide level. The aims of this study were therefore threefold: (1) to combine bioinformatics, physical mapping to produce comprehensive comparative maps of the genomes of chicken and zebra finch. In so doing, this allowed the identification of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements distinguishing them. The previously reported interchromosomal conservation of synteny was confirmed, but a larger than expected number of intrachromosomal rearrangements were reported; (2) to hybridize zebra finch genomic DNA to a chicken tiling path microarray and identify CNVs in the zebra finch genome relative to chicken; 32 interspecific CNVs were identified; and (3) to test the hypothesis that there is an association between CNV, chromosomal rearrangements, and recombination by correlating data from (1) and (2) with recombination rate data from a high-resolution genetic linkage map of the zebra finch. We found a highly significant association of both chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs with elevated recombination rates. The results thus provide support for the notion of recombination-based processes playing a major role in avian genome evolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Understanding the interactions between patterns of recombination, mating systems, and signatures of natural selection is a central aim in evolutionary biology. Patterns of recombination shape the evolution of genomes by affecting the efficacy of selection. Within populations, genetic shuffling is achieved through meiotic recombination, random chromosome segregation, and the frequency of outbreeding. Recombination landscapes vary between species and populations, and are further influenced by mating systems. Here, we use populations of two related grass species, rye (             Secale cereale             ) and barley (             Hordeum vulgare             ssp.             spontaneum             ), that differ in their mating system, to analyse signatures of linked selection under divergent recombination landscapes. Rye (outbreeding) and barley (inbreeding) are members of the Poaceae and diverged approximately 15 M years ago. We estimated population recombination rates, analysed patterns of genetic diversity, identified signatures of linked selection, and quantified the fraction and functional class of genes affected by linked selection. In this comparison, we detected signatures of linked selection in low-recombining regions in both species. In inbreeding barley, the low-recombining fraction of the genome was more than 2-fold larger than in outbreeding rye. Furthermore, considering differences in gene density across the genome, approximately 1.5 times more genes were affected by linked selection in barley than in rye. In both species, genomic regions affected by linked selection harbour mostly genes involved in basic cellular processes. We provide empirical evidence for quantitative differences in recombination landscapes between closely related species of divergent mating systems, and discuss the consequences of linked selection and the efficacy of natural selection.                                   Significance statement             The ability of natural selection to disentangle beneficial from deleterious mutations across the genome is shaped by patterns of recombination, yet our understanding of the magnitude of this interaction is incomplete. In our work, we show that patterns of recombination differ between related outbreeding and inbreeding grass species, and that the efficacy of selection differs between them. We provide empirical evidence for quantitative differences in recombination landscapes and patterns of selection.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Advances in genomics have expedited~the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (               Triticum               spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome               1               , and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines               2,3               . Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses               4,5               . We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of               Sm1               6               , a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars.},

  abstract = {Recombination generates variation and facilitates evolution. Recombination (or lack thereof) also contributes to human genetic disease. Methods for mapping genes influencing complex genetic diseases via association rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in human populations, which is influenced by rates of recombination across the genome. Comparative population genomic analyses of recombination using related primate species can identify factors influencing rates of recombination in humans. Such studies can indicate how variable hotspots for recombination may be both among individuals (or populations) and over evolutionary timescales. Previous studies have suggested that locations of recombination hotspots are not conserved between humans and chimpanzees. We made use of the data sets from recent resequencing projects and applied a Bayesian method for identifying hotspots and estimating recombination rates. We also reanalyzed SNP data sets for regions with known hotspots in humans using samples from the human and chimpanzee. The Bayes factors (BF) of shared recombination hotspots between human and chimpanzee across regions were obtained. Based on the analysis of the aligned regions of human chromosome 21, locations where the two species show evidence of shared recombination hotspots (with high BFs) were identified. Interestingly, previous comparative studies of human and chimpanzee that focused on the known human recombination hotspots within the b-globin and HLA regions did not find overlapping of hotspots. Our results show high BFs of shared hotspots at locations within both regions, and the estimated locations of shared hotspots overlap with the locations of human recombination hotspots obtained from sperm-typing studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Brassica oleracea encompass a family of vegetables and cabbage that are among the most widely cultivated crops. In 2009, the B. oleracea Genome Sequencing Project was launched using next generation sequencing technology. None of the available maps were detailed enough to anchor the sequence scaffolds for the Genome Sequencing Project. This report describes the development of a large number of SSR and SNP markers from the whole genome shotgun sequence data of B. oleracea, and the construction of a high-density genetic linkage map using a double haploid mapping population. Results: The B. oleracea high-density genetic linkage map that was constructed includes 1,227 markers in nine linkage groups spanning a total of 1197.9 cM with an average of 0.98 cM between adjacent loci. There were 602 SSR markers and 625 SNP markers on the map. The chromosome with the highest number of markers (186) was C03, and the chromosome with smallest number of markers (99) was C09. Conclusions: This first high-density map allowed the assembled scaffolds to be anchored to pseudochromosomes. The map also provides useful information for positional cloning, molecular breeding, and integration of information of genes and traits in B. oleracea. All the markers on the map will be transferable and could be used for the construction of other genetic maps.},

However, across a wide variety of organisms, the range of genetic diversity is orders of magnitude more narrow than the range of effective population size. This observation has become known as Lewontin's paradox and although aspects of this phenomenon have been extensively studied, the underlying causes for the paradox remain unclear. Norway spruce (Picea abies) is a widely distributed conifer species across the northern hemisphere, and it consequently plays a major role in European forestry. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing data from 35 individuals to perform population genomic analyses in P.~abies in an effort to understand what drives genome-wide patterns of variation in this species. Despite having a very wide geographic distribution and an corresponding enormous current population size, our analyses find that genetic diversity of P.~abies is low across a number of populations ({$\pi$}\,=\,0.0049 in Central-Europe, {$\pi$}\,=\,0.0063 in Sweden-Norway, {$\pi$}\,=\,0.0063 in Finland). To assess the reasons for the low levels of genetic diversity, we infer the demographic history of the species and find that it is characterized by several reoccurring bottlenecks with concomitant decreases in effective population size can, at least partly, provide an explanation for low polymorphism we observe in P.~abies. Further analyses suggest that recurrent natural selection, both purifying and positive selection, can also contribute to the loss of genetic diversity in Norway spruce by reducing genetic diversity at linked sites. Finally, the overall low mutation rates seen in conifers can also help explain the low genetic diversity maintained in Norway spruce.},

In this research, an F2 population was developed from an interspecific cross between G. hirsutum and G. mustelinum (HM). A genetic linkage map was constructed mainly using simple sequence repeat (SSRs) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) DNA markers. The arrangements of most genetic loci along the HM chromosomes were identical to those of other tetraploid cotton species. However, both major and minor structural rearrangements were also observed, for which we propose a parsimony-based model for structural divergence of tetraploid cottons from common ancestors. Sequences of mapped markers were used for alignment with the 26 scaffolds of the G. hirsutum draft genome, and showed high consistency. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of fiber elongation in advanced backcross populations derived from the same parents demonstrated the value of the HM map. The HM map will serve as a valuable resource for QTL mapping and introgression of G. mustelinum alleles into G. hirsutum, and help clarify evolutionary relationships between the tetraploid cotton genomes.},

  abstract = {Crossover (CO) interference is a universal phenomenon by which the occurrence of one CO event inhibits the simultaneous occurrence of other COs along a chromosome. Because of its critical role in the evolution of genome structure and organization, the cytological and molecular mechanisms underlying CO interference have been extensively investigated. However, the genome-wide distribution of CO interference and its interplay with sex-, stress-, and age-induced differentiation remain poorly understood. Multi-point linkage analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for landscaping CO interference, especially within species for which CO mutants are rarely available. We implemented four-point linkage analysis to landscape a detailed picture of how CO interference is distributed through the entire genome of Populus euphratica, the only forest tree that can survive and grow in saline desert. We identified an extensive occurrence of CO interference, and found that its strength depends on the length of chromosomes and the genomic locations within the chromosome. We detected high-order CO interference, possibly suggesting a highly complex mechanism crucial for P. euphratica to grow, reproduce, and evolve in its harsh environment.},

MCLas-A was suggested as an active MITE because of its mobility. The immediate upstream gene of the two MITEs was predicted to be a putative transposase. The goal of this study is to analyze the sequence variation in the upstream putative transposase of MITEs and explore the possible correlation between sequence variation of transposase gene and MITE activity. PCR and sequence analysis showed that 12 sequence types were found in six major amplicon types from 43 representative `Ca. L. asiaticus' isolates from China, the United States and Brazil. Out of the 12 sequence types, three (T4, T5-2, T6) were reported for the first time. Recombination events were found in the two unique sequence types (T5-2 and T6) which were detected in all Brazilian isolates. Notably, no sequence variation or recombination events were detected in the upstream putative transposase gene of MCLas-A, suggesting the conservation of the transposase gene might be closely related with the MITE activity. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two well supported clades including five subclades were identified, clearly reflecting the geographical origins of isolates, especially that of Ruili isolates, S{\~a}o Paulo isolates and a few Florida isolates.},

  abstract = {Background: The initiation of growth cessation and dormancy represent critical life-history trade-offs between survival and growth and have important fitness effects in perennial plants. Such adaptive life-history traits often show strong local adaptation along environmental gradients but, despite their importance, the genetic architecture of these traits remains poorly understood. Results: We integrate whole genome re-sequencing with environmental and phenotypic data from common garden experiments to investigate the genomic basis of local adaptation across a latitudinal gradient in European aspen (Populus tremula). A single genomic region containing the PtFT2 gene mediates local adaptation in the timing of bud set and explains 65\% of the observed genetic variation in bud set. This locus is the likely target of a recent selective sweep that originated right before or during colonization of northern Scandinavia following the last glaciation. Field and greenhouse experiments confirm that variation in PtFT2 gene expression affects the phenotypic variation in bud set that we observe in wild natural populations. Conclusions: Our results reveal a major effect locus that determines the timing of bud set and that has facilitated rapid adaptation to shorter growing seasons and colder climates in European aspen. The discovery of a single locus explaining a substantial fraction of the variation in a key life-history trait is remarkable, given that such traits are generally considered to be highly polygenic. These findings provide a dramatic illustration of how loci of large-effect for adaptive traits can arise and be maintained over large geographical scales in natural populations.},

Meiotic recombination ensures the formation of bivalents between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and their subsequent proper segregation. It also results in genetic diversity among progeny that influences evolutionary responses to selection. Moreover, crop breeding depends upon the action of meiotic recombination to rearrange elite traits between parental chromosomes. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive meiotic recombination is important for both fundamental research and practical applications. This review emphasizes advances made during the past 5 years, primarily in Arabidopsis and rice, by summarizing newly characterized genes and proteins and examining the regulatory mechanisms that modulate their action.},

However, the extent to which recurrent phenotypic adaptation has arisen via parallelism at the molecular level remains unresolved, as does the evolutionary origin of alleles underlying such adaptation. Here, we investigate genetic mechanisms of convergent highland adaptation in maize landrace populations and evaluate the genetic sources of recurrently selected alleles. Population branch excess statistics reveal substantial evidence of parallel adaptation at the level of individual single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), genes, and pathways in four independent highland maize populations. The majority of convergently selected SNPs originated via migration from a single population, most likely in the Mesoamerican highlands, while standing variation introduced by ancient gene flow was also a contributor. Polygenic adaptation analyses of quantitative traits reveal that alleles affecting flowering time are significantly associated with elevation, indicating the flowering time pathway was targeted by highland adaptation. In addition, repeatedly selected genes were significantly enriched in the flowering time pathway, indicating their significance in adapting to highland conditions. Overall, our study system represents a promising model to study convergent evolution in plants with potential applications to crop adaptation across environmental gradients.},

Here we use whole-genome resequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum, and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus: Populus tremula, P. tremuloides, and P. trichocarpa. We find that P. tremuloides has the highest level of genome-wide variation, skewed allele frequencies, and population-scaled recombination rates, whereas P. trichocarpa harbors the lowest. Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, due to both purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species. Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination largely explain the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection that we observe among species. The present work provides the first phylogenetic comparative study on a genome-wide scale in forest trees. This information will also improve our ability to understand how various evolutionary forces have interacted to influence genome evolution among related species.},

  abstract = {Crossing over is a nearly universal feature of sexual reproduction. Here, analysis of crossover numbers on a per-chromosome and per-nucleus basis reveals a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved feature of meiosis: within individual nuclei, crossover frequencies covary across different chromosomes. This effect results from per-nucleus covariation of chromosome axis lengths. Crossovers can promote evolutionary adaptation. However, the benefit of creating favorable new allelic combinations must outweigh the cost of disrupting existing favorable combinations. Covariation concomitantly increases the frequencies of gametes with especially high, or especially low, numbers of crossovers, and thus might concomitantly enhance the benefits of crossing over while reducing its costs. A four-locus population genetic model suggests that such an effect can pertain in situations where the environment fluctuates: hyper-crossover gametes are advantageous when the environment changes while hypo-crossover gametes are advantageous in periods of environmental stasis. These findings reveal a new feature of the basic meiotic program and suggest a possible adaptive advantage.},

  abstract = {Background: Synonymous codon usage varies widely between genomes, and also between genes within genomes. Although there is now a large body of data on variations in codon usage, it is still not clear if the observed patterns reflect the effects of positive Darwinian selection acting at the level of translational efficiency or whether these patterns are due simply to the effects of mutational bias. In this study, we have included both intra-genomic and inter-genomic comparisons of codon usage. This allows us to distinguish more efficiently between the effects of nucleotide bias and translational selection. Results: We show that there is an extreme degree of heterogeneity in codon usage patterns within the rice genome, and that this heterogeneity is highly correlated with differences in nucleotide content (particularly GC content) between the genes. In contrast to the situation observed within the rice genome, Arabidopsis genes show relatively little variation in both codon usage and nucleotide content. By exploiting a combination of intra-genomic and inter-genomic comparisons, we provide evidence that the differences in codon usage among the rice genes reflect a relatively rapid evolutionary increase in the GC content of some rice genes. We also noted that the degree of codon bias was negatively correlated with gene length. Conclusion: Our results show that mutational bias can cause a dramatic evolutionary divergence in codon usage patterns within a period of approximately two hundred million years.},

Since the advent of highthroughput analysis, huge amounts of functional genomics data have been delivered rapidly, making an integrated online genome browser indispensable for scientists to visualize and analyze these data. Based on next-generation web technologies and high-throughput experimental data, we have developed Rice-Map, a novel genome browser for researchers to navigate, analyze and annotate rice genome interactively. Description: More than one hundred annotation tracks (81 for japonica and 82 for indica) have been compiled and loaded into Rice-Map. These pre-computed annotations cover gene models, transcript evidences, expression profiling, epigenetic modifications, inter-species and intra-species homologies, genetic markers and other genomic features. In addition to these pre-computed tracks, registered users can interactively add comments and research notes to Rice-Map as User-Defined Annotation entries. By smoothly scrolling, dragging and zooming, users can browse various genomic features simultaneously at multiple scales. On-the-fly analysis for selected entries could be performed through dedicated bioinformatic analysis platforms such as WebLab and Galaxy. Furthermore, a BioMartpowered data warehouse ``Rice Mart'' is offered for advanced users to fetch bulk datasets based on complex criteria. Conclusions: Rice-Map delivers abundant up-to-date japonica and indica annotations, providing a valuable resource for both computational and bench biologists. Rice-Map is publicly accessible at http://www.ricemap.org/, with all data available for free downloading.},

Mice HEI10mei4 mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata. In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination. In the rice hei10 mutant, chiasma frequency is markedly reduced, and those remaining chiasmata exhibit a random distribution among cells, suggesting possible involvement of HEI10 in the formation of interference-sensitive crossovers (COs). However, mutation of HEI10 does not affect early recombination events and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes. It initially appears as distinct foci and co-localizes with MER3. Thereafter, HEI10 signals elongate along the chromosomes and finally restrict to prominent foci that specially localize to chiasma sites. The linear HEI10 signals always localize on ZEP1 signals, indicating that HEI10 extends along the chromosome in the wake of synapsis. Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components.},

  abstract = {Background: SNPs are the most abundant polymorphism type, and have been explored in many crop genomic studies, including rice and maize. SNP discovery in allotetraploid cotton genomes has lagged behind that of other crops due to their complexity and polyploidy. In this study, genome-wide SNPs are detected systematically using next-generation sequencing and efficient SNP genotyping methods, and used to construct a linkage map and characterize the structural variations in polyploid cotton genomes. Results: We construct an ultra-dense inter-specific genetic map comprising 4,999,048 SNP loci distributed unevenly in 26 allotetraploid cotton linkage groups and covering 4,042 cM. The map is used to order tetraploid cotton genome scaffolds for accurate assembly of G. hirsutum acc. TM-1. Recombination rates and hotspots are identified across the cotton genome by comparing the assembled draft sequence and the genetic map. Using this map, genome rearrangements and centromeric regions are identified in tetraploid cotton by combining information from the publicly-available G. raimondii genome with fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Conclusions: We report the genotype-by-sequencing method used to identify millions of SNPs between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. We construct and use an ultra-dense SNP map to correct sequence mis-assemblies, merge scaffolds into pseudomolecules corresponding to chromosomes, detect genome rearrangements, and identify centromeric regions in allotetraploid cottons. We find that the centromeric retro-element sequence of tetraploid cotton derived from the D subgenome progenitor might have invaded the A subgenome centromeres after allotetrapolyploid formation. This study serves as a valuable genomic resource for genetic research and breeding of cotton.},

We constructed high-density genetic maps of Zoysia japonica using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach and an F1 mapping population derived from a cross between `Carrizo' and `El Toro'. Two linkage maps were constructed, one for each of the parents. A map consisting of 2408 RAD markers distributed on 21 linkage groups was constructed for `Carrizo'. Another map with 1230 RAD markers mapped on 20 linkage groups was constructed for `El Toro'. The average distance between adjacent markers of the two maps was at 0.56 and 1.4 cM, respectively. Comparative genomics analysis was carried out among zoysiagrass, rice and sorghum genomes and a highly conserved collinearity in the gene order was observed among the three genomes. Chromosome collinearity was disrupted at centromeric regions for each chromosome pair between zoysiagrass and sorghum genomes. However, no obvious synteny gaps were observed across the centromeric regions between zoysiagrass and rice genomes. Two homologous chromosomes for each of the 10 sorghum chromosomes were found in the zoysiagrass genome, indicating an allotetraploid origin for zoysiagrass. The reduction of the basic chromosome number from 12 to 10 in chloridoids and panicoids took place via independent singlestep nested chromosome fusion events after the two subfamilies diverged from a common ancestor. The genetic maps will assist in genome sequence assembly, targeted gene isolation and comparative genomic analyses among grasses.},

  abstract = {Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.), belonging to the genus Zoysia in the subfamily Chloridoideae, is widely used in domestic lawns, sports fields and as forage. We constructed high-density genetic maps of Zoysia japonica using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach and an F1 mapping population derived from a cross between `Carrizo' and `El Toro'. Two linkage maps were constructed, one for each of the parents. A map consisting of 2408 RAD markers distributed on 21 linkage groups was constructed for `Carrizo'. Another map with 1230 RAD markers mapped on 20 linkage groups was constructed for `El Toro'. The average distance between adjacent markers of the two maps was at 0.56 and 1.4 cM, respectively. Comparative genomics analysis was carried out among zoysiagrass, rice and sorghum genomes and a highly conserved collinearity in the gene order was observed among the three genomes. Chromosome collinearity was disrupted at centromeric regions for each chromosome pair between zoysiagrass and sorghum genomes. However, no obvious synteny gaps were observed across the centromeric regions between zoysiagrass and rice genomes. Two homologous chromosomes for each of the 10 sorghum chromosomes were found in the zoysiagrass genome, indicating an allotetraploid origin for zoysiagrass. The reduction of the basic chromosome number from 12 to 10 in chloridoids and panicoids took place via independent singlestep nested chromosome fusion events after the two subfamilies diverged from a common ancestor. The genetic maps will assist in genome sequence assembly, targeted gene isolation and comparative genomic analyses among grasses.},

  abstract = {Background: Sesame is an important high-quality oil seed crop. The sesame genome was de novo sequenced and assembled in 2014 (version 1.0); however, the number of anchored pseudomolecules was higher than the chromosome number (2n = 2x = 26) due to the lack of a high-density genetic map with 13 linkage groups. Results: We resequenced a permanent population consisting of 430 recombinant inbred lines and constructed a genetic map to improve the sesame genome assembly. We successfully anchored 327 scaffolds onto 13 pseudomolecules. The new genome assembly (version 2.0) included 97.5 \% of the scaffolds greater than 150 kb in size present in assembly version 1.0 and increased the total pseudomolecule length from 233.7 to 258.4 Mb with 94.3 \% of the genome assembled and 97.2 \% of the predicted gene models anchored. Based on the new genome assembly, a bin map including 1,522 bins spanning 1090.99 cM was generated and used to identified 41 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for sesame plant height and 9 for seed coat color. The plant height-related QTLs explained 3{\textendash}24 \% the phenotypic variation (mean value, 8 \%), and 29 of them were detected in at least two field trials. Two major loci (qPH-8.2 and qPH-3.3) that contributed 23 and 18 \% of the plant height were located in 350 and 928-kb spaces on Chr8 and Chr3, respectively. qPH-3.3, is predicted to be responsible for the semi-dwarf sesame plant phenotype and contains 102 candidate genes. This is the first report of a sesame semi-dwarf locus and provides an interesting opportunity for a plant architecture study of the sesame. For the sesame seed coat color, the QTLs of the color spaces L*, a*, and b* were detected with contribution rates of 3{\textendash}46 \%. qSCb-4.1 contributed approximately 39 \% of the b* value and was located on Chr4 in a 199.9-kb space. A list of 32 candidate genes for the locus, including a predicted black seed coat-related gene, was determined by screening the newly anchored genome. Conclusions: This study offers a high-density genetic map and an improved assembly of the sesame genome. The number of linkage groups and pseudomolecules in this assembly equals the number of sesame chromosomes for the first time. The map and updated genome assembly are expected to serve as a platform for future comparative genomics and genetic studies.},

  abstract = {Bread wheat is one of the most important crops worldwide. With the release of the complete wheat reference genome and the development of next-generation sequencing technology, a mass of genomic data from bread wheat and its progenitors has been yield and has provided genomic resources for wheat genetics research. To conveniently and effectively access and use these data, we established Wheat Genome Variation Database, an integrated web-database including genomic variations from whole-genome resequencing and exome-capture data for bread wheat and its progenitors, as well as selective signatures during the process of wheat domestication and improvement. In this version, WGVD contains 7 346 814 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1 044 400 indels focusing on genic regions and upstream or downstream regions. We provide allele frequency distribution patterns of these variations for 5 ploidy wheat groups or 17 worldwide bread wheat groups, the annotation of the variant types and the genotypes of all individuals for 2 versions of bread wheat reference genome (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 and IWGSC RefSeq v2.0). Selective footprints for Aegilops tauschii, wild emmer, domesticated emmer, bread wheat landrace and bread wheat variety are evaluated with two statistical tests (F ST and Pi) based on SNPs from whole-genome resequencing data. In addition, we provide the Genome Browser to visualize the genomic variations, the selective footprints, the genotype patterns and the read coverage depth, and the alignment tool Blast to search the homologous regions between sequences. All of these features of WGVD will promote wheat functional studies and wheat breeding.},

  abstract = {Background: Rapid development of highly saturated genetic maps aids molecular breeding, which can accelerate gain per breeding cycle in woody perennial plants such as Rubus idaeus (red raspberry). Recently, robust genotyping methods based on high-throughput sequencing were developed, which provide high marker density, but result in some genotype errors and a large number of missing genotype values. Imputation can reduce the number of missing values and can correct genotyping errors, but current methods of imputation require a reference genome and thus are not an option for most species. Results: Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) was used to produce highly saturated maps for a R. idaeus pseudo-testcross progeny. While low coverage and high variance in sequencing resulted in a large number of missing values for some individuals, a novel method of imputation based on maximum likelihood marker ordering from initial marker segregation overcame the challenge of missing values, and made map construction computationally tractable. The two resulting parental maps contained 4521 and 2391 molecular markers spanning 462.7 and 376.6 cM respectively over seven linkage groups. Detection of precise genomic regions with segregation distortion was possible because of map saturation. Microsatellites (SSRs) linked these results to published maps for cross-validation and map comparison. Conclusions: GBS together with genome-independent imputation provides a rapid method for genetic map construction in any pseudo-testcross progeny. Our method of imputation estimates the correct genotype call of missing values and corrects genotyping errors that lead to inflated map size and reduced precision in marker placement. Comparison of SSRs to published R. idaeus maps showed that the linkage maps constructed with GBS and our method of imputation were robust, and marker positioning reliable. The high marker density allowed identification of genomic regions with segregation distortion in R. idaeus, which may help to identify deleterious alleles that are the basis of inbreeding depression in the species.},

The map consists of 2,177 markers with polymorphism information for 32 accessions and provides a detailed genetic framework for these markers. The marker order on the linkage map revealed close agreement with that on the chromosome-scale assembly, Wm82.a2.v1. The differences, especially on Chr. 5 and Chr. 11, in the present map provides information to identify regions in the genome assembly where additional information is required to resolve marker order and assign remaining scaffolds. To cover the entire soybean genome, we used 999 BC3F2 backcross plants and selected 103 CSSLs carrying chromosomal segments from Peking in the genetic background of Enrei. Using these low-genetic-complexity resources, we dissected variation in traits related to flowering, maturity and yield into approximately 50 reproducible quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and evaluated QTLs with small genetic effects as single genetic factors in a uniform genetic background. CSSLs developed in this study may be good starting material for removing the unfavourable characteristics of Peking during pre-breeding and for isolation of genes conferring disease and stress resistance that have not yet been characterized.},

In this work, we mine and validate a set of 845 SNPs from the aligned transcriptomes of two contrasting inbred lines. Each V. faba SNP is assigned by BLAST analysis to a single Medicago orthologue. This set of syntenically anchored polymorphisms were then validated as individual KASP assays, classified according to their informativeness and performance on a panel of 37 inbred lines, and the best performing 757 markers used to genotype six mapping populations. The six resulting linkage maps were merged into a single consensus map on which 687 SNPs were placed on six linkage groups, each presumed to correspond to one of the six V. faba chromosomes. This sequence-based consensus map was used to explore synteny with the most closely related crop species, lentil and the most closely related fully sequenced genome, Medicago. Large tracts of uninterrupted colinearity were found between faba bean and Medicago, making it relatively straightforward to predict gene content and order in mapped genetic interval. As a demonstration of this, we mapped a flower colour gene to a 2-cM interval of Vf chromosome 2 which was highly colinear with Mt3. The obvious candidate gene from 78 gene models in the collinear Medicago chromosome segment was the previously characterized MtWD40-1 gene controlling anthocyanin production in Medicago and resequencing of the Vf orthologue showed a putative causative deletion of the entire 50 end of the gene.},

  abstract = {Background: While effective population size (Ne) and life history traits such as generation time are known to impact substitution rates, their potential effects on base composition evolution are less well understood. GC content increases with decreasing body mass in mammals, consistent with recombination-associated GC biased gene conversion (gBGC) more strongly impacting these lineages. However, shifts in chromosomal architecture and recombination landscapes between species may complicate the interpretation of these results. In birds, interchromosomal rearrangements are rare and the recombination landscape is conserved, suggesting that this group is well suited to assess the impact of life history on base composition. Results: Employing data from 45 newly and 3 previously sequenced avian genomes covering a broad range of taxa, we found that lineages with large populations and short generations exhibit higher GC content. The effect extends to both coding and non-coding sites, indicating that it is not due to selection on codon usage. Consistent with recombination driving base composition, GC content and heterogeneity were positively correlated with the rate of recombination. Moreover, we observed ongoing increases in GC in the majority of lineages. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that gBGC may drive patterns of nucleotide composition in avian genomes and are consistent with more effective gBGC in large populations and a greater number of meioses per unit time; that is, a shorter generation time. Thus, in accord with theoretical predictions, base composition evolution is substantially modulated by species life history.},

To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 83 animals and yeast. We examined the scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic traits also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture: Guanine and cytosine (GC) content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with lifespan. Among these were very long gene length, due to introns being highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like long interspersed nuclear elements, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale shark genome also has the second slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.},

In this study, we analyzed high-density genotyping by sequencing (GBS) data of 298 African highland adapted maize inbred lines to (i) assess the extent of genetic purity, genetic relatedness, and population structure, and (ii) identify genomic regions that have undergone selection (selective sweeps) in response to adaptation to highland environments. Nearly 91\% of the pairs of inbred lines differed by 30{\textendash}36\% of the scored alleles, but only 32\% of the pairs of the inbred lines had relative kinship coefficient {$<$}0.050, which suggests the presence of substantial redundancy in allelic composition that may be due to repeated use of fewer genetic backgrounds (source germplasm) during line development. Results from different genetic relatedness and population structure analyses revealed three different groups, which generally agrees with pedigree information and breeding history, but less so by heterotic groups and endosperm modification. We identified 944 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers that fell within 22 selective sweeps that harbored 265 protein-coding candidate genes of which some of the candidate genes had known functions. Details of the candidate genes with known functions and differences in nucleotide diversity among groups predicted based on multivariate methods have been discussed.},

Analysis of genic collinearity reveals that the tea genome is the product of two rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGDs) that occurred {$\sim$}30 to 40 and {$\sim$}90 to 100 Mya. We provide evidence that these WGD events, and subsequent paralogous duplications, had major impacts on the copy numbers of secondary metabolite genes, particularly genes critical to producing three key quality compounds: catechins, theanine, and caffeine. Analyses of transcriptome and phytochemistry data show that amplification and transcriptional divergence of genes encoding a large acyltransferase family and leucoanthocyanidin reductases are associated with the characteristic young leaf accumulation of monomeric galloylated catechins in tea, while functional divergence of a single member of the glutamine synthetase gene family yielded theanine synthetase. This genome sequence will facilitate understanding of tea genome evolution and tea metabolite pathways, and will promote germplasm utilization for breeding improved tea varieties.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Recombination is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes via physical crossovers. Pioneered by T. H. Morgan and A. Sturtevant over a century ago, methods to estimate recombination rate and genetic distance require scoring large number of recombinant individuals between molecular or visible markers. While high throughput sequencing methods have allowed for genome wide crossover detection producing high resolution maps, such methods rely on large number of recombinants individually sequenced and are therefore difficult to scale. Here, we present a simple and scalable method to infer near chromosome-wide recombination rate from marker selected pools and the corresponding analytical software MarSuPial. Rather than genotyping individuals from recombinant backcrosses, we bulk sequence marker selected pools to infer the allele frequency decay around the selected locus; since the number of recombinant individuals increases proportionally to the genetic distance from the selected locus, the allele frequency across the chromosome can be used to estimate the genetic distance and recombination rate. We mathematically demonstrate the relationship between allele frequency attenuation, recombinant fraction, genetic distance, and recombination rate in marker selected pools. Based on available chromosome-wide recombination rate models of             Drosophila             , we simulated read counts and determined that nonlinear local regressions (LOESS) produce robust estimates despite the high noise inherent to sequencing data. To empirically validate this approach, we show that (single) marker selected pools closely recapitulate genetic distances inferred from scoring recombinants between double markers. We theoretically determine how secondary loci with viability impacts can modulate the allele frequency decay and how to account for such effects directly from the data. We generated the recombinant map of three wild derived strains which strongly correlates with previous genome-wide measurements. Interestingly, amidst extensive recombination rate variation, multiple regions of the genomes show elevated rates across all strains. Lastly, we apply this method to estimate chromosome-wide crossover interference. Altogether, we find that marker selected pools is a simple and cost effective method for broad recombination rate estimates. Although it does not identify instances of crossovers, it can generate near chromosome-wide recombination maps in as little as one or two libraries.},

  abstract = {Meiosis, the cell division by which eukaryotes produce haploid gametes, is essential for fertility in sexually reproducing species. This process is sensitive to temperature, and can fail outright at temperature extremes. At less extreme values, temperature affects the genome-wide rate of homologous recombination, which has important implications for evolution and population genetics. Numerous studies in laboratory conditions have shown that recombination rate plasticity is common, perhaps nearly universal, among eukaryotes. These studies have also shown that variation in the length or timing of stresses can strongly affect results, raising the important question whether these findings translate to more variable field conditions. Moreover, lower or higher recombination rate could cause certain kinds of meiotic aberrations, especially in polyploid species {\textendash} raising the additional question whether temperature fluctuations in field conditions cause problems. We tested here whether (1) recombination rate varies across a season in the wild in two natural populations of autotetraploid Arabidopsis arenosa, (2) whether recombination rate correlates with temperature fluctuations in nature, and (3) whether natural temperature fluctuations might cause meiotic aberrations. We find that plants in two genetically distinct populations show a similar plastic response with recombination rate increases correlated with both high and low temperatures. In addition, increased recombination rate correlates with increased multivalent formation, especially at lower temperature, hinting that polyploids in particular may suffer meiotic problems in conditions they encounter in nature. Our results show that studies of recombination rate plasticity done in laboratory settings inform our understanding of what happens in nature.},

For sensing performed in electrolytes in particular, abundant information about the translocating analytes is hidden in the fluctuating monitoring ionic current contributed from interactions between the analytes and the nanopore. Such ionic currents are inevitably affected by noise; hence, signal processing is an inseparable component of sensing in order to identify the hidden features in the signals and to analyze them. This Guide starts from untangling the signal processing flow and categorizing the various algorithms developed to extracting the useful information. By sorting the algorithms under Machine Learning (ML)-based versus non-ML-based, their underlying architectures and properties are systematically evaluated. For each category, the development tactics and features of the algorithms with implementation examples are discussed by referring to their common signal processing flow graphically summarized in a chart and by highlighting their key issues tabulated for clear comparison. How to get started with building up an ML-based algorithm is subsequently presented. The specific properties of the ML-based algorithms are then discussed in terms of learning strategy, performance evaluation, experimental repeatability and reliability, data preparation, and data utilization strategy. This Guide is concluded by outlining strategies and considerations for prospect algorithms.},

  abstract = {Individuals of a specified pedigree relationship vary in the proportion of the genome they share identical by descent, i.e. in their realised or actual relationship. Predictions of the variance in realised relationship have previously been based solely on the proportion of the map length shared, which requires the implicit assumption that both recombination rate and genetic information are uniformly distributed along the genome. This ignores the possible existence of recombination hotspots, and fails to distinguish between coding and non-coding sequences. In this paper, we therefore quantify the effects of heterogeneity in recombination rate at broad and fine-scale levels on the variation in realised relationship. Variance is usually greater on a chromosome with a non-uniform recombination rate than on a chromosome with the same map length and uniform recombination rate, especially if recombination rates are higher towards chromosome ends. Reductions in variance can also be obtained, however, and the overall pattern of change is quite complex. In general, local (fine-scale) variation in recombination rate, e.g. hotspots, has a small influence on the variance in realised relationship. Differences in rates across longer regions and between chromosome ends can increase or decrease the variance in a realised relationship, depending on the genomic architecture.},

  abstract = {Background: While transposable elements (TEs) comprise the bulk of plant genomic DNA, how they contribute to genome structure and organization is still poorly understood. Especially in large genomes where TEs make the majority of genomic DNA, it is still unclear whether TEs target specific chromosomal regions or whether they simply accumulate where they are best tolerated. Results: Here, we present an analysis of the repetitive fraction of the 5100 Mb barley genome, the largest angiosperm genome to have a near-complete sequence assembly. Genes make only about 2\% of the genome, while over 80\% is derived from TEs. The TE fraction is composed of at least 350 different families. However, 50\% of the genome is comprised of only 15 high-copy TE families, while all other TE families are present in moderate or low copy numbers. We found that the barley genome is highly compartmentalized with different types of TEs occupying different chromosomal ``niches'', such as distal, interstitial, or proximal regions of chromosome arms. Furthermore, gene space represents its own distinct genomic compartment that is enriched in small non-autonomous DNA transposons, suggesting that these TEs specifically target promoters and downstream regions. Furthermore, their presence in gene promoters is associated with decreased methylation levels. Conclusions: Our data show that TEs are major determinants of overall chromosome structure. We hypothesize that many of the the various chromosomal distribution patterns are the result of TE families targeting specific niches, rather than them accumulating where they have the least deleterious effects.},

Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was used to investigate the genetic architecture of zinc tolerance in this species. A first-generation backcross progeny of A. halleri ssp. halleri from a highly contaminated industrial site and its nontolerant relative A. lyrata ssp. petraea was produced and used for QTL mapping of zinc tolerance. A genetic map covering most of the A. halleri genome was constructed using 85 markers. Among these markers, 65 were anchored in A. thaliana and revealed high synteny with other Arabidopsis genomes. Three QTL of comparable magnitude on three different linkage groups were identified. At all QTL positions zinc tolerance was enhanced by A. halleri alleles, indicating directional selection for higher zinc tolerance in this species. The two-LOD support intervals associated with these QTL cover 24, 4, and 13 cM. The importance of each of these three regions is emphasized by their colocalization with HMA4, MTP1-A, and MTP1-B, respectively, three genes well known to be involved in metal homeostasis and tolerance in plants.},

The data sets are revealing interesting and novel patterns of genomic organization, which provide insight both into molecular evolution and how structure and function of a genome interrelate. Our study investigates, for the first time, how genome organization affects expression of a gene in the               Arabidopsis               genome. The analyses show that neighboring genes are coexpressed.

We have investigated reasons for coexpression of neighboring genes in               Arabidopsis               , and our evidence suggests that orientation of gene pairs plays a significant role, with potential sharing of regulatory elements in divergently transcribed genes.

Using an estimate of the distribution of fitness effects, we show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs). However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection. Additionally, we see reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Finally, using expression data from leaf tissue we show that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, we observe widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but our results also suggest that both positive and negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are considerably rarer than in animal genomes.},

We use our process to show that the joint distribution of pairwise coalescence times at recombination sites under the SMC{${'}$} is the same as it is marginally under the ARG, which demonstrates that the SMC{${'}$} is, in a particular well-defined, intuitive sense, the most appropriate first-order sequentially Markov approximation to the ARG.

  abstract = {The ancestral centromeres of maize contain long stretches of the tandemly arranged CentC repeat. The abundance of tandem DNA repeats and centromeric retrotransposons (CR) has presented a significant challenge to completely assembling centromeres using traditional sequencing methods. Here, we report a nearly complete assembly of the 1.85 Mb maize centromere 10 from inbred B73 using PacBio technology and BACs from the reference genome project. The error rates estimated from overlapping BAC sequences are 7 {\texttimes} 10-6 and 5 {\texttimes} 10-5 for mismatches and indels, respectively. The number of gaps in the region covered by the reassembly was reduced from 140 in the reference genome to three. Three expressed genes are located between 92 and 477 kb from the inferred ancestral CentC cluster, which lies within the region of highest centromeric repeat density. The improved assembly increased the count of full-length CR from 5 to 55 and revealed a 22.7 kb segmental duplication that occurred approximately 121,000 years ago. Our analysis provides evidence of frequent recombination events in the form of partial retrotransposons, deletions within retrotransposons, chimeric retrotransposons, segmental duplications including higher order CentC repeats, a deleted CentC monomer, centromere-proximal inversions, and insertion of mitochondrial sequences. Double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair is the most plausible mechanism for these events and may be the major driver of centromere repeat evolution and diversity. In many cases examined here, DSB repair appears to be mediated by microhomology, suggesting that tandem repeats may have evolved to efficiently repair frequent DSBs in centromeres.},

  abstract = {We describe a comprehensive and general approach for mapping centromeres and present a detailed characterization of two maize centromeres. Centromeres are difficult to map and analyze because they consist primarily of repetitive DNA sequences, which in maize are the tandem satellite repeat CentC and interspersed centromeric retrotransposons of maize (CRM). Centromeres are defined epigenetically by the centromeric histone H3 variant, CENH3. Using novel markers derived from centromere repeats, we have mapped all ten centromeres onto the physical and genetic maps of maize. We were able to completely traverse centromeres 2 and 5, confirm physical maps by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and delineate their functional regions by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with anti-CENH3 antibody followed by pyrosequencing. These two centromeres differ substantially in size, apparent CENH3 density, and arrangement of centromeric repeats; and they are larger than the rice centromeres characterized to date. Furthermore, centromere 5 consists of two distinct CENH3 domains that are separated by several megabases. Succession of centromere repeat classes is evidenced by the fact that elements belonging to the recently active recombinant subgroups of CRM1 colonize the present day centromeres, while elements of the ancestral subgroups are also found in the flanking regions. Using abundant CRM and non-CRM retrotransposons that inserted in and near these two centromeres to create a historical record of centromere location, we show that maize centromeres are fluid genomic regions whose borders are heavily influenced by the interplay of retrotransposons and epigenetic marks. Furthermore, we propose that CRMs may be involved in removal of centromeric DNA (specifically CentC), invasion of centromeres by non-CRM retrotransposons, and local repositioning of the CENH3.},

The new map improves access to the dog's unique biology, from human disease counterparts to fascinating evolutionary adaptations. The map was constructed with {$\sim$}3000 microsatellite markers developed from the reference sequence. Familial resources afforded 450 mostly phase-known meioses for map assembly. The genotype data supported a framework map with {$\sim$}1500 loci. An additional {$\sim$}1500 markers served as map validators, contributing modestly to estimates of recombination rate but supporting the framework content. Data from {$\sim$}22,000 SNPs informing on a subset of meioses supported map integrity. The sex-averaged map extended 21 M and revealed marked region- and sex-specific differences in recombination rate. The map will enable empiric coverage estimates and multipoint linkage analysis. Knowledge of the variation in recombination rate will also inform on genomewide patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and thus benefit association, selective sweep, and phylogenetic mapping approaches. The computational and wet-bench strategies can be applied to the reference genome of any nonmodel organism to assemble a de novo linkage map.},

In non-crop plants, Arabidopsis thaliana is the most renowned model and has been used as study system to elucidate numerous biological processes at the molecular level. Once a complete genome sequence was available, research has markedly accelerated and further established A. thaliana as the reference to stimulate studies in other species with different biology. Within the Brassicaceae family, the arctic-alpine perennial Arabis alpina has become a model complementary to A. thaliana to study life-history evolution and ecological genomics in harsh environments. In this review, we provide an overview of the properties that facilitated the rapid emergence of A. alpina as a plant model. We summarize the evolutionary history of A. alpina, including the diversification of its mating system, and discuss recent progress in the molecular dissection of developmental traits that are related to its perennial life history and environmental adaptation. We indicate open questions from which future research might be developed in other Brassicaceae species or more distantly related plant families.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a major component of eukaryotic  genomes, and exhibit striking deviations from random distribution across the  genomes studied, including humans, flies, nematodes, and plants. Although  considerable progress has been made in documenting these patterns, the causes  are subject to debate. Here, we use the genome sequence of               Arabidopsis  thaliana               to test for the importance of competing models of natural  selection against TE insertions. We show that, despite TE accumulation near  the centromeres, recombination does not generally correlate with TE abundance,  suggesting that selection against ectopic recombination does not influence TE  distribution in               A. thaliana               . In contrast, a consistent negative  correlation between gene density and TE abundance, and a strong  under-representation of TE insertions in introns suggest that selection  against TE disruption of gene expression is playing a more important role in               A. thaliana               . High rates of self-fertilization may reduce the  importance of recombination rate in genome structuring in inbreeding organisms  such as               A. thaliana               and               Caenorhabditis elegans               .},

  abstract = {Evolutionary transitions from outcrossing to selfing are expected to cause a reduction in the effective population size and a corresponding increase in fixation rates of slightly deleterious mutations and decrease in fixation of advantageous mutations. Despite these predictions, evidence from genomic data does not suggest a significant reduction in the efficacy of selection associated with high levels of self-fertilization. Here, we discuss opportunities for selfing populations to avoid an irreversible decline in fitness toward extinction and the implications for genome evolution. Most directly, large population sizes and the purging of deleterious recessive mutations can reduce genetic loads and slow the effects of genetic drift. Theory suggests that recombination rates may also evolve in response to the evolution of mating system, which can offset the harmful effects of inbreeding. Cytological data supporting the evolution of higher recombination rates in selfing species should be supplemented with genetic and molecular methods for estimating this parameter. Mutation rates may also evolve to be higher in selfing plants as a result of hitchhiking with advantageous mutations, although this is unlikely to lead to increased fitness. Finally, the abundance and activity of selfish genetic elements may also be reduced in selfing lineages, reducing the accumulation of transposable elements, B chromosomes, biased gene conversion, and the spread of cytoplasmic male sterility mutations. This reduction in genomic conflict can increase mean fitness, reduce deleterious mutation rates, and reduce genome size. We show, using comparative data, that highly selfing plants have genomes significantly smaller than those of outcrossing relatives, consistent with reduced activity and spread of repetitive elements in inbred plants. We discuss opportunities for tests of theory as plant genomic data accumulate and argue that a genomic perspective on reproductive transitions in a phylogenetic context should provide important insights into the diversity of reproductive systems in flowering plants.},

We formulate the problem of resolving cycles in a combinatorial optimization framework, which in turn is expressed as an integer linear program.

During the past several years, the adoption of high-throughput genotyping technologies has been paralleled by a substantial increase in the density and diversity of genetic markers. New genetic mapping algorithms are needed in order to efficiently process these large datasets and accurately construct highdensity genetic maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to order markers on a genetic linkage map. Our method is based on a simple yet fundamental mathematical property that we prove under rather general assumptions. The validity of this property allows one to determine efficiently the correct order of markers by computing the minimum spanning tree of an associated graph. Our empirical studies obtained on genotyping data for three mapping populations of barley (Hordeum vulgare), as well as extensive simulations on synthetic data, show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the best available methods in the literature, particularly when the input data are noisy or incomplete. The software implementing our algorithm is available in the public domain as a web tool under the name MSTMAP.},

A high-density linkage map is a valuable tool for fine mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and map-based gene cloning. In this study, we firstly constructed a high-density linkage map of pear using SNPs integrated with SSRs, developed by the rapid and robust technology of restriction-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). The linkage map consists of 3143 SNP markers and 98 SSRs, 3241 markers in total, spanning 2243.4 cM, with an average marker distance of 0.70 cM. Anchoring SSRs were able to anchor seventeen linkage groups to their corresponding chromosomes. Based on this high-density integrated pear linkage map and two years of fruit phenotyping, a total of 32 potential QTLs for 11 traits, including length of pedicel (LFP), single fruit weight (SFW), soluble solid content (SSC), transverse diameter (TD), vertical diameter (VD), calyx status (CS), flesh colour (FC), juice content (JC), number of seeds (NS), skin colour (SC), and skin smooth (SS), were identified and positioned on the genetic map. Among them, some important fruit-related traits have for the first time been identified, such as calyx status, length of pedicel, and flesh colour, and reliable localization of QTLs were verified repeatable. This high-density linkage map of pear is a worthy reference for mapping important fruit traits, QTL identification, and comparison and combination of different genetic maps.},

This assumption is not realistic, because considerable sex-related differences have been observed in recombination fraction. In this paper, a general EM-based algorithm is presented to estimate sex-specific recombination fractions for a mixed set of molecular markers segregating differently in a full-sib family derived from two heterozygous parents. The asymptotic variances of the estimates of linkage specifically for each of the parents are evaluated using a numerical analysis based on information functions. This approach will have important implications for precise gene mapping based on sex-specific linkage maps.},

  abstract = {Ultrahigh-density genetic mapping is used extensively for gene discovery, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), and assisting in crop breeding. However, genetic mapping of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) has hitherto been limited in terms of both types and resolution. In this study, 214 F1 progenies derived from a cross of IAN 873 {\texttimes} REYAN 106 were genotyped via a whole-genome resequencing-based (WGRS) approach. From the 44,438,656 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from the genotyping, an ultrahigh-density genetic map was constructed using 203,124 SNPs, which included 2099.12 cM across eighteen linkage groups of the entire rubber tree genome. To the best of our knowledge, an ultrahigh-density genetic map of a rubber tree constructed via the WGRS approach has not yet been reported in literature. Two phenotypes associated with growth, namely, the girth at breast height (GBH) and tree height (TH), were investigated under a six-month interval. A total of six QTLs were found, in which qGBH11 and qGBH18 were detected repeatedly. Based on the physical positions of the bin markers that flank the QTLs, 47 genes identified within the qGBH11 locus, as well as the gene HB11G00752, were selected as the candidate genes that encodes ent-kaur-16-ene synthase (KS), regulating gibberellin biosynthesis. The search results for the KS gene family in the genome indicated that six out of ten KS family members were located in the qGBH11 allele. Expression analysis further shed light on the differential expressions of the KS family genes between F1 individuals having fast and slow growth. These results are expected to provide new insight into the genomic regions that control growth in rubber trees, and also facilitate the development of more effective approaches for breeding fast-growing timber latex clones.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} As an important biofuel plant, the demand for higher yield Jatropha curcas L. is rapidly increasing. However, genetic analysis of Jatropha and molecular breeding for higher yield have been hampered by the limited number of molecular markers available. Results:\hspace{0.6em} An ultrahigh-density linkage map for a Jatropha mapping population of 153 individuals was constructed and covered 1380.58 cM of the Jatropha genome, with average marker density of 0.403 cM. The genetic linkage map consisted of 3422 SNP and indel markers, which clustered into 11 linkage groups. With this map, 13 repeatable QTLs (reQTLs) for fruit yield traits were identified. Ten reQTLs, qNF-1, qNF-2a, qNF-2b, qNF-2c, qNF-3, qNF-4, qNF-6, qNF-7a, qNF-7b and qNF-8, that control the number of fruits (NF) mapped to LGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, whereas three reQTLs, qTWF-1, qTWF-2 and qTWF-3, that control the total weight of fruits (TWF) mapped to LGs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. It is interesting that there are two candidate critical genes, which may regulate Jatropha fruit yield. We also identified three pleiotropic reQTL pairs associated with both the NF and TWF traits. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} This study is the first to report an ultrahigh-density Jatropha genetic linkage map construction, and the markers used in this study showed great potential for QTL mapping. Thirteen fruit-yield reQTLs and two important candidate genes were identified based on this linkage map. This genetic linkage map will be a useful tool for the localization of other economically important QTLs and candidate genes for Jatropha.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is an important model system, which has been widely used in plant physiological studies and it is particularly useful as a bioreactor. Despite its importance, only limited molecular marker resources are available for genome analysis, genetic mapping and breeding. Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) is a powerful new method for targeted sequencing across the genomes of many individuals. This approach has broad potential for genetic analysis through linkage mapping. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a BC1 backcross population. Sequencing of 196 individuals was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Two linkage maps were constructed, one with a reference genome and another, termed as de novo identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by RAD-seq, without a reference genome. Overall, 4138 and 2162 SNP markers with a total length of 1944.74 and 2000.9 cM were mapped to 24 linkage groups in the genetic maps based on reference genome and without reference, respectively. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Using two different SNP discovery methods based on next generation RAD sequencing technology, we have respectively mapped 2162 and 4318 SNPs in our backcross population. This study gives an excellent example for high density linkage map construction, irrespective of genome sequence availability, and provides saturated information for downstream genetic investigations such as quantitative trait locus analyses or genomic selection (e.g. bioreactor suitable cultivars).},

Construction of high-density genetic maps appears more feasible since the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which eases SNP discovery and high-throughput genotyping of large population. In this research, a high-density genetic map of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was successfully constructed across an F2 population by a recently developed Specific Length Amplified Fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method. In total, 18.69 GB of data containing 93,460,000 paired-end reads were obtained after preprocessing. The average sequencing depth was 44.92 in the D8 (female parent), 42.16 in the Jin5-508 (male parent), and 5.01 in each progeny. 79,092 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 6784 SLAFs were polymorphic, and 1892 of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for constructing genetic map. The genetic map spanned 845.87 cm with an average genetic distance of 0.45 cm. It is a reliable linkage map for fine mapping and molecular breeding of cucumber for its high marker density and well-ordered markers.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Genetic linkage maps are critical for assembling draft genomes to a meaningful chromosome level and for deciphering the genomic underpinnings of biological traits. The estimates of recombination rates derived from genetic maps also play an important role in understanding multiple aspects of genomic evolution such as nucleotide substitution patterns and accumulation of deleterious mutations. In this study, we developed a high-throughput experimental approach that combines fluorescence-activated cell sorting, whole-genome amplification, and short-read sequencing to construct a genetic map using single-sperm cells. Furthermore, a computational algorithm was developed to analyze single-sperm whole-genome sequencing data for map construction. These methods allowed us to rapidly build a male-specific genetic map for the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex, which shows significant improvements compared to a previous map. With a total of mapped 1672 haplotype blocks and an average intermarker distance of 0.87 cM, this map spans a total genetic distance of 1451 Kosambi cM and comprises 90\% of the resolved regions in the current Daphnia reference assembly. The map also reveals the mistaken mapping of seven scaffolds in the reference assembly onto chromosome II by a previous microsatellite map based on F2 crosses. Our approach can be easily applied to many other organisms and holds great promise for unveiling the intragenomic and intraspecific variation in the recombination rates.},

  abstract = {Background: Genetic linkage maps are important tools for many genetic applications including mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), identifying DNA markers for fingerprinting, and map-based gene cloning. Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) is an important ornamental flower worldwide. We previously reported a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-based genetic linkage map derived from Dianthus capitatus ssp. andrezejowskianus and a simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based genetic linkage map constructed using data from intraspecific F2 populations; however, the number of markers was insufficient, and so the number of linkage groups (LGs) did not coincide with the number of chromosomes (x = 15). Therefore, we aimed to produce a high-density genetic map to improve its usefulness for breeding purposes and genetic research. Results: We improved the SSR-based genetic linkage map using SSR markers derived from a genomic library, expression sequence tags, and RNA-seq data. Linkage analysis revealed that 412 SSR loci (including 234 newly developed SSR loci) could be mapped to 17 linkage groups (LGs) covering 969.6 cM. Comparison of five minor LGs covering less than 50 cM with LGs in our previous RAPD-based genetic map suggested that four LGs could be integrated into two LGs by anchoring common SSR loci. Consequently, the number of LGs corresponded to the number of chromosomes (x = 15). We added 192 new SSRs, eight RAPD, and two sequence-tagged site loci to refine the RAPD-based genetic linkage map, which comprised 15 LGs consisting of 348 loci covering 978.3 cM. The two maps had 125 SSR loci in common, and most of the positions of markers were conserved between them. We identified 635 loci in carnation using the two linkage maps. We also mapped QTLs for two traits (bacterial wilt resistance and anthocyanin pigmentation in the flower) and a phenotypic locus for flower-type by analyzing previously reported genotype and phenotype data. Conclusions: The improved genetic linkage maps and SSR markers developed in this study will serve as reference genetic linkage maps for members of the genus Dianthus, including carnation, and will be useful for mapping QTLs associated with various traits, and for improving carnation breeding programs.},

Genome-related research in ornamentals plants has been relatively slow to develop because of their heterozygosity or polyploidy.

  abstract = {Background: Cucumber is an important vegetable crop that is susceptible to many pathogens, but no disease resistance (R) genes have been cloned. The availability of whole genome sequences provides an excellent opportunity for systematic identification and characterization of the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) type R gene homolog (RGH) sequences in the genome. Cucumber has a very narrow genetic base making it difficult to construct high-density genetic maps. Development of a consensus map by synthesizing information from multiple segregating populations is a method of choice to increase marker density. As such, the objectives of the present study were to identify and characterize NB-LRR type RGHs, and to develop a high-density, integrated cucumber genetic-physical map anchored with RGH loci. Results: From the Gy14 draft genome, 70 NB-containing RGHs were identified and characterized. Most RGHs were in clusters with uneven distribution across seven chromosomes. In silico analysis indicated that all 70 RGHs had EST support for gene expression. Phylogenetic analysis classified 58 RGHs into two clades: CNL and TNL. Comparative analysis revealed high-degree sequence homology and synteny in chromosomal locations of these RGH members between the cucumber and melon genomes. Fifty-four molecular markers were developed to delimit 67 of the 70 RGHs, which were integrated into a genetic map through linkage analysis. A 1,681-locus cucumber consensus map including 10 gene loci and spanning 730.0 cM in seven linkage groups was developed by integrating three component maps with a bin-mapping strategy. Physically, 308 scaffolds with 193.2 Mbp total DNA sequences were anchored onto this consensus map that covered 52.6\% of the 367 Mbp cucumber genome. Conclusions: Cucumber contains relatively few NB-LRR RGHs that are clustered and unevenly distributed in the genome. All RGHs seem to be transcribed and shared significant sequence homology and synteny with the melon genome suggesting conservation of these RGHs in the Cucumis lineage. The 1,681-locus consensus genetic-physical map developed and the RGHs identified and characterized herein are valuable genomics resources that may have many applications such as quantitative trait loci identification, map-based gene cloning, association mapping, marker-assisted selection, as well as assembly of a more complete cucumber genome.},

Here, we show that the Arabidopsis cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1/Cdk2 homolog CDKA;1 is an important regulator of meiosis needed for several aspects of meiosis such as chromosome synapsis. We identify the chromosome axis protein ASYNAPTIC 1 (ASY1), the Arabidopsis homolog of Hop1 (homolog pairing 1), essential for synaptonemal complex formation, as a target of CDKA;1. The phosphorylation of ASY1 is required for its recruitment to the chromosome axis via ASYNAPTIC 3 (ASY3), the Arabidopsis reductional division 1 (Red1) homolog, counteracting the disassembly activity of the AAA+ ATPase PACHYTENE CHECKPOINT 2 (PCH2). Furthermore, we have identified the closure motif in ASY1, typical for HORMA domain proteins, and provide evidence that the phosphorylation of ASY1 regulates the putative self-polymerization of ASY1 along the chromosome axis. Hence, the phosphorylation of ASY1 by CDKA;1 appears to be a two-pronged mechanism to initiate chromosome axis formation in meiosis.},

  abstract = {Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) is the most recently domesticated crop in major agricultural cultivation. Its seeds are high in protein and dietary fibre, but low in oil and starch. Medical and dietetic studies have shown that consuming lupin-enriched food has significant health benefits. We report the draft assembly from a whole genome shotgun sequencing dataset for this legume species with 26.9x coverage of the genome, which is predicted to contain 57,807 genes. Analysis of the annotated genes with metabolic pathways provided a partial understanding of some key features of lupin, such as the amino acid profile of storage proteins in seeds. Furthermore, we applied the NGS-based RAD-sequencing technology to obtain 8,244 sequence-defined markers for anchoring the genomic sequences. A total of 4,214 scaffolds from the genome sequence assembly were aligned into the genetic map. The combination of the draft assembly and a sequence-defined genetic map made it possible to locate and study functional genes of agronomic interest. The identification of co-segregating SNP markers, scaffold sequences and gene annotation facilitated the identification of a candidate R gene associated with resistance to the major lupin disease anthracnose. We demonstrated that the combination of medium-depth genome sequencing and a high-density genetic linkage map by application of NGS technology is a cost-effective approach to generating genome sequence data and a large number of molecular markers to study the genomics, genetics and functional genes of lupin, and to apply them to molecular plant breeding. This strategy does not require prior genome knowledge, which potentiates its application to a wide range of non-model species.},

However, except for human and a few model organisms, it is not well studied in livestock, including cattle.                                         Results               To investigate their distributions in the cattle sperm genome, we sequenced 143 single sperms from two Holstein bulls. We mapped meiotic recombination events at high resolution based on phased heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In the absence of evolutionary selection pressure in fertilization and survival, recombination events in sperm are enriched near distal chromosomal ends, revealing that such a pattern is intrinsic to the molecular mechanism of meiosis. Furthermore, we further validated these findings in single sperms with results derived from sequencing its family trio of diploid genomes and our previous studies of recombination in cattle.

Mapping QTLs to narrow chromosomal regions provides an effective means of characterizing the genetic basis of these complex traits. Orychophragmus violaceus is a crucifer with long siliques, many SS, and heavy seeds. A novel B. napus introgression line with many SS was previously selected from multiple crosses (B. rapa ssp. chinesis {\texttimes} O. violaceus) {\texttimes} B. napus. In present study, a doubled haploid (DH) population with 167 lines was established from a cross between the introgression line and a line with far fewer SS, in order to detect QTLs for silique-related traits. By screening with a Brassica 60K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, a high-density linkage map consisting of 1,153 bins and spanning a cumulative length of 2,209.1 cM was constructed, using 12,602 high-quality polymorphic SNPs in the DH population. The average recombination bin densities of the A and C subgenomes were 1.7 and 2.4 cM, respectively. 45 QTLs were identified for the three traits in all, which explained 4.0{\textendash}34.4\% of the total phenotypic variation; 20 of them were integrated into three unique QTLs by meta-analysis. These unique QTLs revealed a significant positive correlation between SS and SL and a significant negative correlation between SW and SS, and were mapped onto the linkage groups A05, C08, and C09. A trait-by-trait meta-analysis revealed eight, four, and seven consensus QTLs for SS, SW, and SL, respectively, and five major QTLs (cqSS.A09b, cqSS.C09, cqSW.A05, cqSW.C09, and cqSL.C09) were identified. Five, three, and four QTLs for SS, SW, and SL, respectively, might be novel QTLs because of the existence of alien genetic loci for these traits in the alien introgression. Thirty-eight candidate genes underlying nine QTLs for silique-related traits were identified.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               As a fundamental genomic element, meiotic recombination hotspot plays important roles in life sciences. Thus uncovering its regulatory mechanisms has broad impact on biomedical research. Despite the recent identification of the zinc finger protein PRDM9 and its 13-mer binding motif as major regulators for meiotic recombination hotspots, other regulators remain to be discovered. Existing methods for finding DNA sequence motifs of recombination hotspots often rely on the enrichment of co-localizations between hotspots and short DNA patterns, which ignore the cross-individual variation of recombination rates and sequence polymorphisms in the population. Our objective in this paper is to capture signals encoded in genetic variations for the discovery of recombination-associated DNA motifs.                                         Results               Recently, an algorithm called ``LDsplit'' has been designed to detect the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and proximal meiotic recombination hotspots. The association is measured by the difference of population recombination rates at a hotspot between two alleles of a candidate SNP. Here we present an open source software tool of LDsplit, with integrative data visualization for recombination hotspots and their proximal SNPs. Applying LDsplit on SNPs inside an established 7-mer motif bound by PRDM9 we observed that SNP alleles preserving the original motif tend to have higher recombination rates than the opposite alleles that disrupt the motif. Running on SNP windows around hotspots each containing an occurrence of the 7-mer motif, LDsplit is able to guide the established motif finding algorithm of MEME to recover the 7-mer motif. In contrast, without LDsplit the 7-mer motif could not be identified.                                         Conclusions                                LDsplit is a software tool for the discovery of                 cis                 -regulatory DNA sequence motifs stimulating meiotic recombination hotspots by screening and narrowing down to hotspot associated SNPs. It is the first computational method that utilizes the genetic variation of recombination hotspots among individuals, opening a new avenue for motif finding. Tested on an established motif and simulated datasets, LDsplit shows promise to discover novel DNA motifs for meiotic recombination hotspots.},

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigated chromosome synteny among cucumber, C. hystrix and melon using integrated and complementary approaches. We identified 14 inversions and a C. hystrix lineage-specific reciprocal inversion between C. hystrix and melon. The results reveal the location and orientation of 53 C. hystrix syntenic blocks on the seven cucumber chromosomes, and allow us to infer at least 59 chromosome rearrangement events that led to the seven cucumber chromosomes, including five fusions, four translocations, and 50 inversions. The 12 inferred chromosomes (AK1{\textendash}AK12) of an ancestor similar to melon and C. hystrix had strikingly different evolutionary fates, with cucumber chromosome C1 apparently resulting from insertion of chromosome AK12 into the centromeric region of translocated AK2/AK8, cucumber chromosome C3 originating from a Robertsonian-like translocation between AK4 and AK6, and cucumber chromosome C5 originating from fusion of AK9 and AK10. Chromosomes C2, C4 and C6 were the result of complex reshuffling of syntenic blocks from three (AK3, AK5 and AK11), three (AK5, AK7 and AK8) and five (AK2, AK3, AK5, AK8 and AK11) ancestral chromosomes, respectively, through 33 fusion, translocation and inversion events. Previous results (Huang, S., Li, R., Zhang, Z. et al., 2009, Nat. Genet. 41, 1275{\textendash}1281; Li, D., Cuevas, H.E., Yang, L., Li, Y., Garcia-Mas, J., Zalapa, J., Staub, J.E., Luan, F., Reddy, U., He, X., Gong, Z., Weng, Y. 2011a, BMC Genomics, 12, 396) showing that cucumber C7 stayed largely intact during the entire evolution of Cucumis are supported. Results from this study allow a fine-scale understanding of the mechanisms of dysploid chromosome reduction that has not been achieved previously.},

  abstract = {Angiosperms (flowering plants) are the most diverse and species-rich group of plants. The vast majority (\$99.95\%) of angiosperms form a clade called Mesangiospermae, which is subdivided into five major groups: eudicots, monocots, magnoliids, Chloranthales, and Ceratophyllales. The relationships among these Mesangiospermae groups have been the subject of long debate. In this study, we assembled a phylogenomic dataset of 1594 genes from 151 angiosperm taxa, including representatives of all five lineages, to investigate the phylogeny of major angiosperm lineages under both coalescent- and concatenationbased methods. We dissected the phylogenetic signal and found that more than half of the genes lack phylogenetic information for the backbone of angiosperm phylogeny. We further removed the genes with weak phylogenetic signal and showed that eudicots, Ceratophyllales, and Chloranthales form a clade, with magnoliids and monocots being the next successive sister lineages. Similar frequencies of gene tree conflict are suggestive of incomplete lineage sorting along the backbone of the angiosperm phylogeny. Our analyses suggest that a fully bifurcating species tree may not be the best way to represent the early radiation of angiosperms. Meanwhile, we inferred that the crown-group angiosperms originated approximately between 255.1 and 222.2 million years ago, and Mesangiospermae diversified into the five extant groups in a short time span (\$27 million years) at the Early to Late Jurassic.},

  abstract = {Despite its global importance as a crop with broad economic, dietary, and cultural importance, the origins of maize and its closest wild relatives remained the topic of vigorous debate for nearly a century. Molecular analyses ultimately concluded that maize was domesticated once from a common ancestor with its closest extant relative, the lowland wild grass Zea mays ssp. parviglumis. But neither the current genetic model nor earlier models based on archaeological data account for the totality of available data, and recent work has highlighted the potential contribution of a second wild relative, the highland Zea mays ssp. mexicana. Here we present a detailed population genetic analysis of the contributions of both wild taxa to modern maize diversity using the largest sample of traditional maize varieties sequenced to date. We show that all modern maize can trace its origin to an ancient admixture event between domesticated ancient maize and Zea mays ssp. mexicana in the highlands of Mexico ca 5300 cal BP, some 4,000 years after domestication began. We show that variation in admixture is a key component of modern maize genetic and phenotypic diversity, both at the level of individual loci and as a factor driving a substantial component of additive genetic variation across a number of agronomic traits. Our results clarify the long-debated origin of modern maize, highlight the potential contributions of crop wild relatives to agronomic improvement, and raise new questions about the anthropogenic mechanisms underlying multiple waves of dispersal throughout the Americas.},

Here, we compared population-genomic data between D. pulex and D. pulicaria, two reproductively compatible sister species experiencing ecological speciation, the first largely confined to intermittent ponds and the second to permanent lakes in the same geographic region. D. pulicaria has lower genome-wide nucleotide diversity, a smaller effective population size, higher incidence of private alleles, and substantially more linkage-disequilibrium than D. pulex. Positively selected genes in D. pulicaria are enriched in potentially aging-related categories such as cellular homeostasis, which may explain the extended lifespan in D. pulicaria. We also found that opsin-related genes, which may mediate photoperiodic responses, are under different selection pressures in these two species. Genes involved in mitochondrial functions, ribosomes, and responses to environmental stimuli are found to be under positive selection in both species. Additionally, we found that the two species have similar average evolutionary rates at the DNA-sequence level, although {$\sim$}160 genes have significantly different rates in the two lineages. Our results provide insights into the physiological traits that differ within this regionally sympatric sister-species pair that occupies unique microhabitats.},

  abstract = {Meiosis is a specialized eukaryotic cell division that generates haploid gametes required for sexual reproduction. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and undergo reciprocal genetic exchange, termed crossover (CO). Meiotic CO frequency varies along the physical length of chromosomes and is determined by hierarchical mechanisms, including epigenetic organization, for example methylation of the DNA and histones. Here we investigate the role of DNA methylation in determining patterns of CO frequency along Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes. In A. thaliana the pericentromeric regions are repetitive, densely DNA methylated, and suppressed for both RNA polymerase-II transcription and CO frequency. DNA hypomethylated methyltransferase1 (met1) mutants show transcriptional reactivation of repetitive sequences in the pericentromeres, which we demonstrate is coupled to extensive remodeling of CO frequency. We observe elevated centromere-proximal COs in met1, coincident with pericentromeric decreases and distal increases. Importantly, total numbers of CO events are similar between wild type and met1, suggesting a role for interference and homeostasis in CO remodeling. To understand recombination distributions at a finer scale we generated CO frequency maps close to the telomere of chromosome 3 in wild type and demonstrate an elevated recombination topology in met1. Using a pollen-typing strategy we have identified an intergenic nucleosome-free CO hotspot 3a, and we demonstrate that it undergoes increased recombination activity in met1. We hypothesize that modulation of 3a activity is caused by CO remodeling driven by elevated centromeric COs. These data demonstrate how regional epigenetic organization can pattern recombination frequency along eukaryotic chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Karyotype, including the chromosome and arm numbers, is a fundamental genetic characteristic of all organisms and has long been used as a species-diagnostic character. Additionally, karyotype evolution plays an important role in divergent adaptation and speciation. Centric fusion and fission change chromosome numbers, whereas the intra-chromosomal movement of the centromere, such as pericentric inversion, changes arm numbers. A probabilistic model simultaneously incorporating both chromosome and arm numbers has not been established. Here, we built a probabilistic model of karyotype evolution based on the ``karyograph'', which treats karyotype evolution as a walk on the two-dimensional space representing the chromosome and arm numbers. This model enables analysis of the stationary distribution with a stable karyotype for any given parameter. After evaluating their performance using simulated data, we applied our model to two large taxonomic groups of fish, Eurypterygii and series Otophysi, to perform maximum likelihood estimation of the transition rates and reconstruct the evolutionary history of karyotypes. The two taxa significantly differed in the evolution of arm number. The inclusion of speciation and extinction rates demonstrated possibly high extinction rates in species with karyotypes other than the most typical karyotype in both groups. Finally, we made a model including polyploidization rates and applied it to a small plant group. Thus, the use of this probabilistic model can contribute to a better understanding of tempo and mode in karyotype evolution and its possible role in speciation and extinction.},

  abstract = {Meiotic crossovers are essential for ensuring correct chromosome segregation as well as for creating new combinations of alleles for natural selection to take place. During meiosis, excess meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated; a subset of these breaks are repaired to form crossovers, whereas the remainder are repaired as non-crossovers. What determines where meiotic DSBs are created and whether a crossover or non-crossover will be formed at any particular DSB remains largely unclear. Nevertheless, several recent papers have revealed important insights into the factors that control the decision between crossover and non-crossover formation in meiosis, including DNA elements that determine the positioning of meiotic DSBs, and the generation and processing of recombination intermediates. In this review, we focus on the factors that influence DSB positioning, the proteins required for the formation of recombination intermediates and how the processing of these structures generates either a crossover or non-crossover in various organisms. A discussion of crossover interference, assurance and homeostasis, which influence crossing over on a chromosome-wide and genome-wide scale {\textendash} in addition to current models for the generation of interference {\textendash} is also included.

  abstract = {Background: Cotton, with a large genome, is an important crop throughout the world. A high-density genetic linkage map is the prerequisite for cotton genetics and breeding. A genetic map based on simple polymerase chain reaction markers will be efficient for marker-assisted breeding in cotton, and markers from transcribed sequences have more chance to target genes related to traits. To construct a genome-wide, functional markerbased genetic linkage map in cotton, we isolated and mapped expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) from cotton ESTs derived from the A1, D5, (AD)1, and (AD)2 genome. Results: A total of 3177 new EST-SSRs developed in our laboratory and other newly released SSRs were used to enrich our interspecific BC1 genetic linkage map. A total of 547 loci and 911 loci were obtained from our EST-SSRs and the newly released SSRs, respectively. The 1458 loci together with our previously published data were used to construct an updated genetic linkage map. The final map included 2316 loci on the 26 cotton chromosomes, 4418.9 cM in total length and 1.91 cM in average distance between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map is one of the three most dense linkage maps in cotton. Twenty-one segregation distortion regions (SDRs) were found in this map; three segregation distorted chromosomes, Chr02, Chr16, and Chr18, were identified with 99.9\% of distorted markers segregating toward the heterozygous allele. Functional analysis of SSR sequences showed that 1633 loci of this map (70.6\%) were transcribed loci and 1332 loci (57.5\%) were translated loci. Conclusions: This map lays groundwork for further genetic analyses of important quantitative traits, markerassisted selection, and genome organization architecture in cotton as well as for comparative genomics between cotton and other species. The segregation distorted chromosomes can be a guide to identify segregation distortion loci in cotton. The annotation of SSR sequences identified frequent and rare gene ontology items on each chromosome, which is helpful to discover functions of cotton chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Papaya is a major fruit crop in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide and has primitive sex chromosomes controlling sex determination in this trioecious species. The papaya genome was recently sequenced because of its agricultural importance, unique biological features, and successful application of transgenic papaya for resistance to papaya ringspot virus. As a part of the genome sequencing project, we constructed a BAC-based physical map using a high information-content fingerprinting approach to assist whole genome shotgun sequence assembly. Results: The physical map consists of 963 contigs, representing 9.4{\texttimes} genome equivalents, and was integrated with the genetic map and genome sequence using BAC end sequences and a sequence-tagged high-density genetic map. The estimated genome coverage of the physical map is about 95.8\%, while 72.4\% of the genome was aligned to the genetic map. A total of 1,181 high quality overgo (overlapping oligonucleotide) probes representing conserved sequences in Arabidopsis and genetically mapped loci in Brassica were anchored on the physical map, which provides a foundation for comparative genomics in the Brassicales. The integrated genetic and physical map aligned with the genome sequence revealed recombination hotspots as well as regions suppressed for recombination across the genome, particularly on the recently evolved sex chromosomes. Suppression of recombination spread to the adjacent region of the male specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY), and recombination rates were recovered gradually and then exceeded the genome average. Recombination hotspots were observed at about 10 Mb away on both sides of the MSY, showing 7-fold increase compared with the genome wide average, demonstrating the dynamics of recombination of the sex chromosomes. Conclusion: A BAC-based physical map of papaya was constructed and integrated with the genetic map and genome sequence. The integrated map facilitated the draft genome assembly, and is a valuable resource for comparative genomics and map-based cloning of agronomically and economically important genes and for sex chromosome research.},

  abstract = {Resequencing or reference-based assemblies reveal large parts of the small-scale sequence variation. However, they typically fail to separate such local variation into colinear and rearranged variation, because they usually do not recover the complement of large-scale rearrangements, including transpositions and inversions. Besides the availability of hundreds of genomes of diverse               Arabidopsis thaliana               accessions, there is so far only one full-length assembled genome: the reference sequence. We have assembled 117 Mb of the               A. thaliana               Landsberg               erecta               (L               er               ) genome into five chromosome-equivalent sequences using a combination of short Illumina reads, long PacBio reads, and linkage information. Whole-genome comparison against the reference sequence revealed 564 transpositions and 47 inversions comprising {$\sim$}3.6 Mb, in addition to 4.1 Mb of nonreference sequence, mostly originating from duplications. Although rearranged regions are not different in local divergence from colinear regions, they are drastically depleted for meiotic recombination in heterozygotes. Using a 1.2-Mb inversion as an example, we show that such rearrangement-mediated reduction of meiotic recombination can lead to genetically isolated haplotypes in the worldwide population of               A. thaliana               . Moreover, we found 105 single-copy genes, which were only present in the reference sequence or the L               er               assembly, and 334 single-copy orthologs, which showed an additional copy in only one of the genomes. To our knowledge, this work gives first insights into the degree and type of variation, which will be revealed once complete assemblies will replace resequencing or other reference-dependent methods.},

However, the genetic basis for these traits is still poorly understood, which has dramatically hindered the breeding of high yield in this fiber crop. Herein, a high-density genetic map with 6,433 markers spanning 2476.5\,cM was constructed using a population derived from two parents, cultivated ramie Zhongsizhu 1 (ZSZ1) and its wild progenitor               B. nivea               var.               tenacissima               (BNT). The fiber yield (FY) and its four related traits{\textemdash}stem diameter (SD) and length (SL), stem bark weight (BW) and thickness (BT){\textemdash}were performed for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, resulting in a total of 47 QTLs identified. Forty QTLs were mapped into 12 genomic regions, thus forming 12 QTL clusters. Among 47 QTLs, there were 14 QTLs whose wild allele from BNT was beneficial. Interestingly, all QTLs in Cluster 10 displayed overdominance, indicating that the region of this cluster was likely heterotic loci. In addition, four fiber yield-related genes underwent positive selection were found either to fall into the FY-related QTL regions or to be near to the identified QTLs. The dissection of FY and FY-related traits not only improved our understanding to the genetic basis of these traits, but also provided new insights into the domestication of FY in ramie. The identification of many QTLs and the discovery of beneficial alleles from wild species provided a basis for the improvement of yield traits in ramie breeding.},

In this study, a population of 191 F9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between two winter cultivars Yumai 8679 and Jing 411. A dense genetic linkage map with 10,816 markers was constructed by incorporating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker information. Five spike morphological traits and plant height were evaluated under nine environments for the RILs and parental lines, and the number of detected environmentally stable QTLs were 18 and three, respectively. The 1RS/1BL (rye) translocation increased both spike length and spikelet number with constant spikelet compactness. The QPht.cau-2D.1 was identical to gene Rht8, which decreased spike length without modifying spikelet number. Notably, four novel QTLs locating on chromosomes 1AS (QSc.cau-1A.1), 2DS (QSc.cau-2D.1), and 7BS (QSl.cau-7B.1 and QSl.cau-7B.2) were firstly identified in this study, which provide further insights into the genetic factors that shaped the spike morphology in wheat. Moreover, SNP markers tightly linked to previously reported QTLs will eventually facilitate future studies including their positional cloning or marker-assisted selection.},

  abstract = {Background: Asian lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is the national flower of India, Vietnam, and one of the top ten traditional Chinese flowers. Although lotus is highly valued for its ornamental, economic and cultural uses, genomic information, particularly the expressed sequence based (genic) markers is limited. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing provides large amounts of transcriptome data for promoting gene discovery and development of molecular markers. Results: In this study, 68,593 unigenes were assembled from 1.34 million 454 GS-FLX sequence reads of a mixed flower-bud cDNA pool derived from three accessions of N. nucifera. A total of 5,226 SSR loci were identified, and 3,059 primer pairs were designed for marker development. Di-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant type identified with a frequency of 65.2\%, followed by tri- (31.7\%), tetra- (2.1\%), penta- (0.5\%) and hexa-nucleotide repeats (0.5\%). A total of 575 primer pairs were synthesized, of which 514 (89.4\%) yielded PCR amplification products. In eight Nelumbo accessions, 109 markers were polymorphic. They were used to genotype a sample of 44 accessions representing diverse wild and cultivated genotypes of Nelumbo. The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 9 alleles and the polymorphism information content values ranged from 0.6 to 0.9. We performed genetic diversity analysis using 109 polymorphic markers. A UPGMA dendrogram was constructed based on Jaccard's similarity coefficients revealing distinct clusters among the 44 accessions. Conclusions: Deep transcriptome sequencing of lotus flower buds developed 3,059 genic SSRs, making a significant addition to the existing SSR markers in lotus. Among them, 109 polymorphic markers were successfully validated in 44 accessions of Nelumbo. This comprehensive set of genic SSR markers developed in our study will facilitate analyses of genetic diversity, construction of linkage maps, gene mapping, and marker-assisted selection breeding for lotus.},

  abstract = {Key message\hspace{0.6em} We identified, mapped and introduced novel Aegilops speltoides-derived resistance genes for tan spot and SNB diseases into wheat, enhancing understanding and utilization of host resistance to both diseases in wheat. Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Tan spot and Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) are two important fungal diseases of wheat. Resistance to these diseases is often observed as the lack of sensitivity to the necrotrophic effectors (NE) produced by the fungal pathogens and thus exhibits a recessive inheritance pattern. In this study, we identified novel genes for resistance to tan spot and SNB on Aegilops speltoides (2n\,=\,2x\,=\,14, genome SS) chromosome 2S. These genes confer dominant resistance in the wheat background, indicating a distinct NE-independent mechanism of resistance. Ae. speltoides chromosome 2S was engineered for resistance gene introgression and molecular mapping by inducing meiotic homoeologous recombination with wheat chromosome 2B. Twenty representative 2B{\textendash}2S recombinants were evaluated for reaction to tan spot and SNB and were delineated by genomic in situ hybridization and high-throughput wheat 90 K SNP assay. The resistance genes physically mapped to the sub-telomeric region ({\textasciitilde}\,8 Mb) on the short arm of chromosome 2S and designated TsrAes1 for tan spot resistance and SnbAes1 for SNB resistance. In addition, we developed SNP-derived PCR markers closely linked to TsrAes1/SnbAes1 for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. TsrAes1 and SnbAes1 are the first set of NE-independent tan spot, and SNB resistance genes are identified from Ae. speltoides. The 2SS{\textendash}2BS{$\cdot$}2BL recombinants with minimal amounts of Ae. speltoides chromatin containing TsrAes1/SnbAes1 were produced for germplasm development, making the wild species-derived resistance genes usable in wheat breeding. This will strengthen and diversify resistance of wheat to tan spot and SNB and facilitate understanding of resistance to these two diseases.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Codon usage bias (CUB) analysis is an effective method for studying specificity, evolutionary relationships, and mRNA translation and discovering new genes among various species. In general, CUB analysis is mainly performed within one species or between closely related species and no such study has been applied among species with distant genetic relationships. Here, seven Rosales species with high economic value were selected to conduct CUB analysis. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The results showed that the average GC1, GC2 and GC3 contents were 51.08, 40.52 and 43.12\%, respectively, indicating that the A/T content is more abundant and the Rosales species prefer A/T as the last codon. Neutrality plot and ENc plot analysis revealed that natural selection was the main factor leading to CUB during the evolution of Rosales species. All 7 Rosales species contained three high-frequency codons, AGA, GTT and TTG, encoding Arg, Val and Leu, respectively. The 7 Rosales species differed in high-frequency codon pairs and the distribution of GC3, though the usage patterns of closely related species were more consistent. The results of the biclustering heat map among 7 Rosales species and 20 other species were basically consistent with the results of genome data, suggesting that CUB analysis is an effective method for revealing evolutionary relationships among species at the family or order level. In addition, chlorophytes prefer using G/C as ending codon, while monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants prefer using A/T as ending codon. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The CUB pattern among Rosales species was mainly affected by natural selection. This work is the first to highlight the CUB patterns and characteristics of Rosales species and provides a new perspective for studying genetic relationships across a wide range of species.},

  abstract = {During meiosis, each pair of homologous chromosomes typically undergoes at least one crossover (crossover assurance), but these exchanges are strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes (crossover interference). The molecular basis for this chromosome-wide regulation remains mysterious. A family of meiotic RING finger proteins has been implicated in crossover regulation across eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans expresses four such proteins, of which one (ZHP-3) is known to be required for crossovers. Here we investigate the functions of ZHP-1, ZHP-2, and ZHP-4. We find that all four ZHP proteins, like their homologs in other species, localize to the synaptonemal complex, an unusual, liquid crystalline compartment that assembles between paired homologs. Together they promote accumulation of pro-crossover factors, including ZHP-3 and ZHP-4, at a single recombination intermediate, thereby patterning exchanges along paired chromosomes. These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical, symmetry-breaking process that enables crossovers to direct accurate chromosome segregation.           ,              Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, giving 46 chromosomes in total. When a cell divides, it typically copies all its chromosomes and distributes the copies equally between the two new cells, so that they also have 46 chromosomes. Cells in the reproductive organs undergo a special division process called meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. As a result, sperm and eggs have just 23 chromosomes, and so when they combine, the fertilized egg receives a complete set of 46 chromosomes.             A similar process happens in all species that use sexual reproduction. As the chromosomes prepare to separate, they line up side by side in matching pairs. During this period, DNA from one chromosome will swap with DNA from its partner. These events are called ``crossovers,'' and because such exchanges can happen at many locations along the chromosomes, no two sperm or eggs are the same.             Historic studies in fruit flies revealed that chromosomes do not mix their DNA at random. After one crossover occurs, it is less likely that another will happen, and if there are two crossovers, the second one tends be far away from the first. This suggests that there must be a signal that tells the chromosomes about the exchange. However, the nature of the signals and how they are communicated along pairs of chromosomes remain mysterious.             A structure called the ``synaptonemal complex'' holds chromosomes together while they mix their DNA. In 2017, researchers found that this structure behaves like a liquid crystal: its molecules are organized into a regular, repeating pattern, but they move freely, like a fluid. If signals could move through this material, this might explain how information spreads along paired chromosomes.             Now, Zhang et al. {\textendash} including two researchers involved in the 2017 work {\textendash} identify some of the signals in the small roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, as four related proteins named ZHPs. When tagged with fluorescent markers and followed under a microscope, all four ZHP proteins moved to the liquid crystal-like synaptonemal complex during meiosis. Depleting the proteins at this crucial time revealed their roles. Two of the proteins are needed for chromosomes to mix their DNA, while the other two control the number of exchanges between each pair of chromosomes. Successful meiosis depended upon all four ZHPs, and so too did the fertility of the worms.             The next step is to find the other molecules that interact with the ZHP proteins during meiosis. Since similar proteins appear in other species, including humans, this could help to reveal more about how genetic traits from our parents mix and match. In the future, studies that build on these findings could also help scientists to understand how errors in these processes give rise to birth defects and infertility.},

  abstract = {Background: Flax is an important field crop that can be used for either oilseed or fiber production. Plant height and technical length are important characters for flax. For linseed flax, plants usually have a short technical length and plant height than those for fiber flax. As an important agronomical character for fiber and linseed flax, plant height is usually a selection target for breeding. However, because of limited technologies and methods available, there has been little research focused on discovering the molecular mechanism controlling plant height. Results: In this study, two related recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations developed from crosses of linseed and fiber parents were developed and phenotyped for plant height and technical length in four environments. A consensus linkage map based on two RIL populations was constructed using SNP markers generated by genotyping by sequencing (GBS) technology. A total of 4497 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were included on 15 linkage groups with an average marker density of one marker every 2.71 cM. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis was performed for plant height and technical length using the two populations. A total of 19 QTLs were identified for plant height and technical length. For the MH population, eight plant height QTLs and seven technical length QTLs were identified, five of which were common QTLs for both traits. For the PH population, six plant height and three technical length QTLs were identified. By comparing the QTLs and candidate gene information in the two population, two common QTLs and three candidate genes were discovered. Conclusions: This study provides a foundation for map-based cloning of QTLs and marker-assisted selection for plant height-related traits in linseed and fiber flax.},

  abstract = {Background: The genetics and molecular biology of sesame has only recently begun to be studied even though sesame is an important oil seed crop. A high-density genetic map for sesame has not been published yet due to a lack of sufficient molecular markers. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a recently developed high-resolution strategy for large-scale de novo SNP discovery and genotyping. SLAF-seq was employed in this study to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for sesame. Results: In total, 28.21 Gb of data containing 201,488,285 pair-end reads was obtained after sequencing. The average coverage for each SLAF marker was 23.48-fold in the male parent, 23.38-fold in the female parent, and 14.46-fold average in each F2 individual. In total, 71,793 high-quality SLAFs were detected of which 3,673 SLAFs were polymorphic and 1,272 of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for use in the construction of a genetic map. The final map included 1,233 markers on the 15 linkage groups (LGs) and was 1,474.87 cM in length with an average distance of 1.20 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map is the densest genetic linkage map to date for sesame. `SNP\_only' markers accounted for 87.51\% of the markers on the map. A total of 205 markers on the map showed significant (P {$<$} 0.05) segregation distortion. Conclusions: We report here the first high-density genetic map for sesame. The map was constructed using an F2 population and the SLAF-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time. Results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/QTL fine mapping, map-based gene isolation, and molecular breeding for sesame, but will also serve as a reference for positioning sequence scaffolds on a physical map, to assist in the process of assembling the sesame genome sequence.},

  abstract = {Background: Soybean is not only an important oil crop, but also an important source of edible protein and industrial raw material. Yield-traits and quality-traits are increasingly attracting the attention of breeders. Therefore, fine mapping the QTLs associated with yield-traits and quality-traits of soybean would be helpful for soybean breeders. In the present study, a high-density linkage map was constructed to identify the QTLs for the yield-traits and quality-traits, using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). Results: SLAF-seq was performed to screen SLAF markers with 149 F8:11 individuals from a cross between a semi wild soybean, `Huapidou', and a cultivated soybean, `Qihuang26', which generated 400.91 M paired-end reads. In total, 53,132 polymorphic SLAF markers were obtained. The genetic linkage map was constructed by 5111 SLAF markers with segregation type of aa{\texttimes}bb. The final map, containing 20 linkage groups (LGs), was 2909.46 cM in length with an average distance of 0.57 cM between adjacent markers. The average coverage for each SLAF marker on the map was 81.26-fold in the male parent, 45.79-fold in the female parent, and 19.84-fold average in each F8:11 individual. According to the high-density map, 35 QTLs for plant height (PH), 100-seeds weight (SW), oil content in seeds (Oil) and protein content in seeds (Protein) were found to be distributed on 17 chromosomes, and 14 novel QTLs were identified for the first time. The physical distance of 11 QTLs was shorter than 100 Kb, suggesting a direct opportunity to find candidate genes. Furthermore, three pairs of epistatic QTLs associated with Protein involving 6 loci on 5 chromosomes were identified. Moreover, 13, 14, 7 and 9 genes, which showed tissue-specific expression patterns, might be associated with PH, SW, Oil and Protein, respectively. Conclusions: With SLAF-sequencing, some novel QTLs and important QTLs for both yield-related and quality traits were identified based on a new, high-density linkage map. Moreover, 43 genes with tissue-specific expression patterns were regarded as potential genes in further study. Our findings might be beneficial to molecular markerassisted breeding, and could provide detailed information for accurate QTL localization.},

  abstract = {Key message\hspace{0.6em} We constructed a homoeologous recombination-based bin map of wheat chromosome 7B, providing a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues in wheat and its relatives. Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Homoeologous recombination leads to the dissection and diversification of the wheat genome. Advances in genome sequencing and genotyping have dramatically improved the efficacy and throughput of homoeologous recombination-based genome studies and alien introgression in wheat and its relatives. In this study, we aimed to physically dissect and map wheat chromosome 7B by inducing meiotic recombination of chromosome 7B with its homoeologues 7E in Thinopyrum elongatum and 7S in Aegilops speltoides. The special genotypes, which were double monosomic for chromosomes 7B'\,+\,7E' or 7B'\,+\,7S' and homozygous for the ph1b mutant, were produced to enhance 7B\,-\,7E and 7B\,-\,7S recombination. Chromosome-specific DNA markers were developed and used to pre-screen the large recombination populations for 7B\,-\,7E and 7B\,-\,7S recombinants. The DNA marker-mediated preselections were verified by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). In total, 29 7B\,-\,7E and 61 7B\,-\,7S recombinants and multiple chromosome aberrations were recovered and delineated by GISH and the wheat 90 K SNP assay. Integrated GISH and SNP analysis of the recombinants physically mapped the recombination breakpoints and partitioned wheat chromosome 7B into 44 bins with 523 SNPs assigned within. A composite bin map was constructed for chromosome 7B, showing the bin size and physical distribution of SNPs. This provides a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues. In addition, the 7B\,-\,7E and 7B\,-\,7S recombinants extend the genetic variability of wheat chromosome 7B and represent useful germplasm for wheat breeding. Thereby, this genomics-enabled chromosome engineering approach facilitates wheat genome study and enriches the gene pool of wheat improvement.},

SynDH1 is a tetraploidization-hexaploid doubled haploid (DH) population because it contains recombinant A and B chromosomes from two different T. turgidum genotypes, while all the D chromosomes from Ae. tauschii are homogenous across the whole population.

These included 513 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers, 72 simple sequence repeat (SSR), one insertion site-based polymorphism (ISBP), and two high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) markers.

This map showed good coverage of the A and B genome chromosomes, apart from 3A, 5A, 6A, and 4B. Compared with previously reported maps, most shared markers showed highly consistent orders. This map was successfully used to identify five quantitative trait loci (QTL), including two for spikelet number on chromosomes 7A and 5B, two for spike length on 7A and 3B, and one for 1000-grain weight on 4B. However, differences in crossability QTL between the two T. turgidum parents may explain the segregation distortion regions on chromosomes 1A, 3B, and 6B. Conclusions: A genetic map of T. turgidum including 588 markers was constructed using a synthetic doubled haploid (SynDH) hexaploid wheat population. Five QTLs for three agronomic traits were identified from this population. However, more markers are needed to increase the density and resolution of this map in the future study.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Tea is an important global beverage crop and is largely clonally propagated. Despite previous studies on the species, its genetic and evolutionary history deserves further research. Here, we present a haplotype-resolved assembly of an Oolong tea cultivar, Tieguanyin. Analysis of allele-specific expression suggests a potential mechanism in response to mutation load during long-term clonal propagation. Population genomic analysis using 190               Camellia               accessions uncovered independent evolutionary histories and parallel domestication in two widely cultivated varieties, var.               sinensis               and var.               assamica               . It also revealed extensive intra- and interspecific introgressions contributing to genetic diversity in modern cultivars. Strong signatures of selection were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that contribute to flavor characteristics as well as genes likely involved in the Green Revolution in the tea industry. Our results offer genetic and molecular insights into the evolutionary history of               Camellia sinensis               and provide genomic resources to further facilitate gene editing to enhance desirable traits in tea crops.},

  abstract = {Background: Pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) is an economically important crop belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. However, very few genomic and genetic resources are available for this species. As part of our ongoing efforts to sequence the pumpkin genome, high-density genetic map is essential for anchoring and orienting the assembled scaffolds. In addition, a saturated genetic map can facilitate quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Results: A set of 186 F2 plants derived from the cross of pumpkin inbred lines Rimu and SQ026 were genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Using the SNPs we identified, a high-density genetic map containing 458 bin-markers was constructed, spanning a total genetic distance of 2,566.8 cM across the 20 linkage groups of C. maxima with a mean marker density of 5.60 cM. Using this map we were able to anchor 58 assembled scaffolds that covered about 194.5 Mb (71.7 \%) of the 271.4 Mb assembled pumpkin genome, of which 44 (183.0 Mb; 67.4 \%) were oriented. Furthermore, the high-density genetic map was used to identify genomic regions highly associated with an important agronomic trait, dwarf vine. Three QTLs on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 3 and 4, respectively, were recovered. One QTL, qCmB2, which was located in an interval of 0.42 Mb on LG 3, explained 21.4 \% phenotypic variations. Within qCmB2, one gene, Cma\_004516, encoding the gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase in the GA biosynthesis pathway, had a 1249-bp deletion in its promoter in bush type lines, and its expression level was significantly increased during the vine growth and higher in vine type lines than bush type lines, supporting Cma\_004516 as a possible candidate gene controlling vine growth in pumpkin. Conclusions: A high-density pumpkin genetic map was constructed, which was used to successfully anchor and orient the assembled genome scaffolds, and to identify QTLs highly associated with pumpkin vine length. The map provided a valuable resource for gene cloning and marker assisted breeding in pumpkin and other related species. The identified vine length QTLs would help to dissect the underlying molecular basis regulating pumpkin vine growth.},

  abstract = {Background: First flower node (FFN) is an important trait for evaluating fruit earliness in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). The trait is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL); however, studies have been limited on QTL mapping and genes contributing to the trait. Results: In this study, we developed a high density genetic map using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), a high-throughput strategy for de novo single nucleotide polymorphism discovery, based on 146 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an intraspecific cross between PM702 and FS871. The map contained 9328 SLAF markers on 12 linkage groups (LGs), and spanned a total genetic distance of 2009.69 centimorgan (cM) with an average distance of 0.22 cM. The sequencing depth for the map was 72.39-fold in the male parent, 57.04-fold in the female parent, and 15.65-fold in offspring. Using the genetic map, two major QTLs, named Ffn2.1 and Ffn2.2, identified on LG02 were strongly associated with FFN, with a phenotypic variance explanation of 28.62 and 19.56\%, respectively. On the basis of the current annotation of C. annuum cv. Criollo de Morelos (CM334), 59 candidate genes were found within the Ffn2.1 and Ffn2.2 region, but only 3 of 59 genes were differentially expressed according to the RNA-seq results. Eventually we identified one gene associated with the FFN based on the function through GO, KEGG, and Swiss-prot analysis. Conclusions: Our research showed that the construction of high-density genetic map using SLAF-seq is a valuable tool for fine QTL mapping. The map we constructed is by far the most saturated complete genetic map of pepper, and using it we conducted fine QTL mapping for the important trait, FFN. QTLs and candidate genes obtained in this study lay a good foundation for the further research on FFN-related genes and other genetic applications in pepper.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Improving fiber quality and yield are the primary research objectives in cotton breeding for enhancing the economic viability and sustainability of Upland cotton production. Identifying the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fiber quality and yield traits using the high-density SNP-based genetic maps allows for bridging genomics with cotton breeding through marker assisted and genomic selection. In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, derived from cross between two parental accessions, which represent broad allele diversity in Upland cotton, was used to construct high-density SNP-based linkage maps and to map the QTLs controlling important cotton traits.                                         Results               Molecular genetic mapping using RIL population produced a genetic map of 3129 SNPs, mapped at a density of 1.41\,cM. Genetic maps of the individual chromosomes showed good collinearity with the sequence based physical map. A total of 106 QTLs were identified which included 59 QTLs for six fiber quality traits, 38 QTLs for four yield traits and 9 QTLs for two morphological traits. Sub-genome wide, 57 QTLs were mapped in A sub-genome and 49 were mapped in D sub-genome. More than 75\% of the QTLs with favorable alleles were contributed by the parental accession NC05AZ06. Forty-six mapped QTLs each explained more than 10\% of the phenotypic variation. Further, we identified 21 QTL clusters where 12 QTL clusters were mapped in the A sub-genome and 9 were mapped in the D sub-genome. Candidate gene analyses of the 11 stable QTL harboring genomic regions identified 19 putative genes which had functional role in cotton fiber development.                                         Conclusion               We constructed a high-density genetic map of SNPs in Upland cotton. Collinearity between genetic and physical maps indicated no major structural changes in the genetic mapping populations. Most traits showed high broad-sense heritability. One hundred and six QTLs were identified for the fiber quality, yield and morphological traits. Majority of the QTLs with favorable alleles were contributed by improved parental accession. More than 70\% of the mapped QTLs shared the similar map position with previously reported QTLs which suggest the genetic relatedness of Upland cotton germplasm. Identification of QTL clusters could explain the correlation among some fiber quality traits in cotton. Stable and major QTLs and QTL clusters of traits identified in the current study could be the targets for map-based cloning and marker assisted selection (MAS) in cotton breeding. The genomic region on D12 containing the major stable QTLs for micronaire, fiber strength and lint percentage could be potential targets for MAS and gene cloning of fiber quality traits in cotton.},

  abstract = {Nicotiana langsdorffii is one of two species of Nicotiana known to express an incompatible interaction with the oomycete Peronospora tabacina, the causal agent of tobacco blue mold disease. We previously showed that incompatibility is due to the hypersensitive response (HR), and plants expressing the HR are resistant to P. tabacina at all stages of growth. Resistance is due to a single dominant gene in N. langsdorffii accession S-4-4 that we have named NlRPT. In further characterizing this unique host-pathogen interaction, NlRPT has been placed on a preliminary genetic map of the N. langsdorffii genome. Allelic scores for five classes of DNA markers were determined for 90 progeny of a ``modified backcross'' involving two N. langsdorffii inbred lines and the related species N. forgetiana. All markers had an expected segregation ratio of 1:1, and were scored in a common format. The map was constructed with JoinMap 3.0, and loci showing excessive transmission distortion were removed. The linkage map consists of 266 molecular marker loci defined by 217 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), 26 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs), 10 conserved orthologous sequence markers, nine inter-simple sequence repeat markers, and four target region amplification polymorphism markers arranged in 12 linkage groups with a combined length of 1062 cM. NlRPT is located on linkage group three, flanked by four AFLP markers and one SSR. Regions of skewed segregation were detected on LGs 1, 5, and 9. Markers developed for N. langsdorffii are potentially useful genetic tools for other species in Nicotiana section Alatae, as well as in N. benthamiana. We also investigated whether AFLPs could be used to infer genetic relationships within N. langsdorffii and related species from section Alatae. A phenetic analysis of the AFLP data showed that there are two main lineages within N. langsdorffii, and that both contain populations expressing dominant resistance to P. tabacina.},

  abstract = {Background: Lotus is a diploid plant with agricultural, medicinal, and ecological significance. Genetic linkage maps are fundamental resources for genome and genetic study, and also provide molecular markers for breeding in agriculturally important species. Genotyping by sequencing revolutionized genetic mapping, the restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) allowed rapid discovery of thousands of SNPs markers, and a crucial aspect of the sequence based mapping strategy is the reference sequences used for marker identification. Results: We assessed the effectiveness of linkage mapping using three types of references for scoring markers: the unmasked genome, repeat masked genome, and gene models. Overall, the repeat masked genome produced the optimal genetic maps. A high-density genetic map of American lotus was constructed using an F1 population derived from a cross between Nelumbo nucifera `China Antique' and N. lutea `AL1'. A total of 4,098 RADseq markers were used to construct the American lotus `AL1' genetic map, and 147 markers were used to construct the Chinese lotus `China Antique' genetic map. The American lotus map has 9 linkage groups, and spans 494.3 cM, with an average distance of 0.7 cM between adjacent markers. The American lotus map was used to anchor scaffold sequences in the N. nucifera `China Antique' draft genome. 3,603 RADseq markers anchored 234 individual scaffold sequences into 9 megascaffolds spanning 67\% of the 804 Mb draft genome. Conclusions: Among the unmasked genome, repeat masked genome and gene models, the optimal reference sequences to call RADseq markers for map construction is repeat masked genome. This high density genetic map is a valuable resource for genomic research and crop improvement in lotus.},

In this study we test for association between orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) heading date and polymorphisms in the CONSTANS (DgCO1), FLOWERING TIME (DgFT1), a VRN1 like MADS-box (DgMADS), and PHOTOPERIOD (DgPPD1-like) containing genes. A diverse population of 150 genotypes was measured for heading date across three years, genotyped, and candidate genes sequenced. Although pairwise population kinship values were generally low, the genotypes fit into a two-group structure model. Linkage disequilibrium decayed rapidly, reaching r2 levels below 0.2 within the 500 bp of each gene. SNPs significantly associated with heading date were detected in equal-dose and tetraploid dosage models. The DgCO1 gene had the most significant polymorphisms and those with the largest effects, while DgMADS had several significant polymorphisms in its first intron with smaller effects. These polymorphisms can be used for further validation, selection, and development of breeding lines of orchardgrass.},

Some map functions were found to fit data better than others. When there are more than three markers, multilocus recombination probabilities cannot be uniquely determined by the defining property of map functions, and different methods have been proposed to permit the use of map functions to analyze multilocus data. If for a given map function, there is a probability model for recombination that can give rise to it, then joint recombination probabilities can be deduced from this model. This provides another way to use map functions in multilocus analysis. In this paper we show that stationary renewal processes give rise to most of the map functions in the literature. Furthermore, we show that the interevent distributions of these renewal processes can all be approximated quite wellby gamma distributions.},

Many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for SY and SYRTs have been reported in Brassica napus; however, no studies have focused on seven agronomic traits simultaneously affecting SY. Genome-wide QTL analysis for SY and seven SYRTs in eight environments was conducted in a doubled haploid population containing 348 lines. Totally, 18 and 208 QTLs for SY and SYRTs were observed, respectively, and then these QTLs were integrated into 144 consensus QTLs using a meta-analysis. Three major QTLs for SY were observed, including cqSY-C6-2 and cqSY-C6-3 that were expressed stably in winter cultivation area for 3 years and cqSY-A2-2 only expressed in spring rapeseed area. Trait-by-trait meta-analysis revealed that the 144 consensus QTLs were integrated into 72 pleiotropic unique QTLs. Among them, all the unique QTLs affected SY, except for uq.A6-1, including uq.A2-3, uq.C1-2, uq.C1-3, uq.C6-1, uq.C6-5, and uq.C6-6 could also affect more than two SYRTs. According to the constructed high-density consensus map and QTL comparison from literatures, 36 QTLs from five populations were co-localized with QTLs identified in this study. In addition, 13 orthologous genes were observed, including five each gene for SY and thousand seed weight, and one gene each for biomass yield, branch height, and plant height. The genomic information of these QTLs will be valuable in hybrid cultivar breeding and in analyzing QTL expression in different environments.},

With the development of molecular genetic technologies such as RFLP, multilocus data are readily available to researchers. Several methods have been developed to analyze such data, and each performs well under restrictive conditions. The present paper proposes a method based on a multiplicative model and maximum-likelihood estimation of recombination fractions and interference coefficients. The estimators are consistent regardless of the model assumptions and are efficient if the model is a good approximation. The estimators are tractable even when there are incomplete observations. Furthermore, the interference between nonadjacent chromosomal regions or those among three chromosomal regions can be modeled and tested by a simple Z-test. The proposed method was applied to linkage analysis of four-locus data obtained from Drosophila and that of seven-locus data obtained again from Drosophila. Reanalysis of the first example revealed that there is interference between chromosomal regions 2 and 3. Analysis of the second example suggested that there is triple interference as well as pairwise interference between nonadjacent chromosomal regions; the genetic interpretation of these findings remains to be developed.},

  abstract = {Meiotic recombination is a fundamental process that generates genetic diversity and ensures the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes. While a great deal is known about genetic factors that regulate recombination, relatively little is known about epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation. In maize, we examined the effects on meiotic recombination of a mutation in a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway,               Mop1               (               Mediator of paramutation1               ), as well as a mutation in a component of the               trans               -acting small interference RNA biogenesis pathway,               Lbl1               (               Leafbladeless1               ). MOP1 is of particular interest with respect to recombination because it is responsible for methylation of transposable elements that are immediately adjacent to transcriptionally active genes. In the               mop1               mutant, we found that meiotic recombination is uniformly decreased in pericentromeric regions but is generally increased in gene rich chromosomal arms. This observation was further confirmed by cytogenetic analysis showing that although overall crossover numbers are unchanged, they occur more frequently in chromosomal arms in               mop1               mutants. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, our data show that crossover redistribution is driven by loss of CHH (where H = A, T, or C) methylation within regions near genes. In contrast to what we observed in               mop1               mutants, no significant changes were observed in the frequency of meiotic recombination in               lbl1               mutants. Our data demonstrate that CHH methylation has a significant impact on the overall recombination landscape in maize despite its low frequency relative to CG and CHG methylation.},

We further found that the               mop1               mutation increased meiotic recombination frequencies in chromosomal arms but decreased them in pericentromeric regions. Our data demonstrate that although CHH methylation is present at a much lower level than CG and CHG methylation, it has a substantial effect on recombination frequencies, suggesting an important role for RNA-directed DNA methylation in meiotic recombination in maize.                        ,                             Meiotic recombination is a fundamental process that generates genetic diversity and ensures the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes. While a great deal is known about genetic factors that regulate recombination, relatively little is known about epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation. In maize, we examined the effects on meiotic recombination of a mutation in a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway,               Mop1               (               Mediator of paramutation1               ), as well as a mutation in a component of the               trans               -acting small interference RNA biogenesis pathway,               Lbl1               (               Leafbladeless1               ). MOP1 is of particular interest with respect to recombination because it is responsible for methylation of transposable elements that are immediately adjacent to transcriptionally active genes. In the               mop1               mutant, we found that meiotic recombination is uniformly decreased in pericentromeric regions but is generally increased in gene rich chromosomal arms. This observation was further confirmed by cytogenetic analysis showing that although overall crossover numbers are unchanged, they occur more frequently in chromosomal arms in               mop1               mutants. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, our data show that crossover redistribution is driven by loss of CHH (where H = A, T, or C) methylation within regions near genes. In contrast to what we observed in               mop1               mutants, no significant changes were observed in the frequency of meiotic recombination in               lbl1               mutants. Our data demonstrate that CHH methylation has a significant impact on the overall recombination landscape in maize despite its low frequency relative to CG and CHG methylation.},

  abstract = {Codon usage biases are found in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and preferred codons are more frequently used in highly expressed genes. The effects of codon usage on gene expression were previously thought to be mainly mediated by its impacts on translation. Here, we show that codon usage strongly correlates with both protein and mRNA levels genome-wide in the filamentous fungus               Neurospora               . Gene codon optimization also results in strong up-regulation of protein and RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that the impact of codon usage on gene expression results mainly from effects on transcription and is largely independent of mRNA translation and mRNA stability. Furthermore, we show that histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the codon usage-mediated transcriptional silencing of some genes with nonoptimal codons. Together, these results uncovered an unexpected important role of codon usage in ORF sequences in determining transcription levels and suggest that codon biases are an adaptation of protein coding sequences to both transcription and translation machineries. Therefore, synonymous codons not only specify protein sequences and translation dynamics, but also help determine gene expression levels.},

  abstract = {Background: Plant architecture attributes, such as plant height, ear height, and internode number, have played an important role in the historical increases in grain yield, lodging resistance, and biomass in maize (Zea mays L.). Analyzing the genetic basis of variation in plant architecture using high density QTL mapping will be of benefit for the breeding of maize for many traits. However, the low density of molecular markers in existing genetic maps has limited the efficiency and accuracy of QTL mapping. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is an improved strategy for addressing a complex genome via next-generation sequencing technology. GBS has been a powerful tool for SNP discovery and high-density genetic map construction. The creation of ultra-high density genetic maps using large populations of advanced recombinant inbred lines (RILs) is an efficient way to identify QTL for complex agronomic traits. Results: A set of 314 RILs derived from inbreds Ye478 and Qi319 were generated and subjected to GBS. A total of 137,699,000 reads with an average of 357,376 reads per individual RIL were generated, which is equivalent to approximately 0.07-fold coverage of the maize B73 RefGen\_V3 genome for each individual RIL. A high-density genetic map was constructed using 4183 bin markers (100-Kb intervals with no recombination events). The total genetic distance covered by the linkage map was 1545.65 cM and the average distance between adjacent markers was 0.37 cM with a physical distance of about 0.51 Mb. Our results demonstrated a relatively high degree of collinearity between the genetic map and the B73 reference genome. The quality and accuracy of the bin map for QTL detection was verified by the mapping of a known gene, pericarp color 1 (P1), which controls the color of the cob, with a high LOD value of 80.78 on chromosome 1. Using this high-density bin map, 35 QTL affecting plant architecture, including 14 for plant height, 14 for ear height, and seven for internode number were detected across three environments. Interestingly, pQTL10, which influences all three of these traits, was stably detected in three environments on chromosome 10 within an interval of 14.6 Mb. Two MYB transcription factor genes, GRMZM2G325907 and GRMZM2G108892, which might regulate plant cell wall metabolism are the candidate genes for qPH10. Conclusions: Here, an ultra-high density accurate linkage map for a set of maize RILs was constructed using a GBS strategy. This map will facilitate identification of genes and exploration of QTL for plant architecture in maize. It will also be helpful for further research into the mechanisms that control plant architecture while also providing a basis for marker-assisted selection.},

However, the number of known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling kernel length is limited. In the present study, we aimed to identify major QTLs for kernel length, as well as putative candidate genes that might influence kernel length in wild barley. Results: A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the barley cultivar Baudin (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) and the long-kernel wild barley genotype Awcs276 (H.vulgare ssp. spontaneum) was evaluated at one location over three years. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 1,832 genome-wide diversity array technology (DArT) markers, spanning a total of 927.07 cM with an average interval of approximately 0.49 cM. Two major QTLs for kernel length, LEN-3H and LEN-4H, were detected across environments and further validated in a second RIL population derived from Fleet (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) and Awcs276. In addition, a systematic search of public databases identified four candidate genes and four categories of proteins related to LEN-3H and LEN-4H. Conclusions: This study establishes a fundamental research platform for genomic studies and marker-assisted selection, since LEN-3H and LEN-4H could be used for accelerating progress in barley breeding programs that aim to improve kernel length.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Recombination rates vary significantly across the genome, and estimates of recombination rates are needed for downstream analyses such as haplotype phasing and genotype imputation. Existing methods for recombination rate estimation are limited by insufficient amounts of informative genetic data or by high computational cost. We present a method for using segments of identity by descent to infer recombination rates. Our method can be applied to sequenced population cohorts to obtain high-resolution, population-specific recombination maps. We use our method to generate new recombination maps for European Americans and for African Americans from TOPMed sequence data from the Framingham Heart Study (1626 unrelated individuals) and the Jackson Heart Study (2046 unrelated individuals). We compare our maps to existing maps using the Pearson correlation between estimated recombination rates. In Europeans we use the deCODE map, which is based on a very large set of Icelandic family data (126,407 meioses), as a gold standard against which to compare other maps. Our European American map has higher accuracy at fine-scale resolution (1-10kb) than linkage disequilibrium maps from the HapMap and 1000 Genomes projects. Our African American map has much higher accuracy than an admixture-based map that is derived from a similar number individuals, and similar accuracy at fine scales (1-10kb) to an admixture-based map that is derived from 15 times as many individuals.},

  abstract = {The relationship between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and recombination fraction can be used to infer the pattern of genetic variation and evolutionary process in humans and other systems. We described a computational framework to construct a linkage{\textendash}LD map from commonly used biallelic, singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for outcrossing plants by which the decline of LD is visualized with genetic distance. The framework was derived from an open-pollinated (OP) design composed of plants randomly sampled from a natural population and seeds from each sampled plant, enabling simultaneous estimation of the LD in the natural population and recombination fraction due to allelic co-segregation during meiosis. We modified the framework to infer evolutionary pasts of natural populations using those marker types that are segregating in a dominant manner, given their role in creating and maintaining population genetic diversity. A sophisticated two-level EM algorithm was implemented to estimate and retrieve the missing information of segregation characterized by dominant-segregating markers such as single methylation polymorphisms. The model was applied to study the relationship between linkage and LD for a non-model outcrossing species, a gymnosperm species, Torreya grandis, naturally distributed in mountains of the southeastern China. The linkage{\textendash}LD map constructed from various types of molecular markers opens a powerful gateway for studying the history of plant evolution.},

Resistance to anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is a major objective of walnut genetic improvement in China. The recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is an efficient strategy that can obtain large numbers of markers with sufficient sequence information to construct high-density genetic maps and permits detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular breeding. Results: SLAF-seq generated 161.64 M paired-end reads. 153,820 SLAF markers were obtained, of which 49,174 were polymorphic. 13,635 polymorphic markers were sorted into five segregation types and 2,577 markers of them were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 2,395 of these fell into 16 linkage groups (LGs) for the female map, 448 markers for the male map, and 2,577 markers for the integrated map. Taking into account the size of all LGs, the marker coverage was 2,664.36 cM for the female map, 1,305.58 cM for the male map, and 2,457.82 cM for the integrated map. The average intervals between two adjacent mapped markers were 1.11 cM, 2.91 cM and 0.95 cM for three maps, respectively. `SNP\_only' markers accounted for 89.25 \% of the markers on the integrated map. Mapping markers contained 5,043 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci, which corresponded to two SNP loci per SLAF marker. According to the integrated map, we used interval mapping (Logarithm of odds, LOD {$>$} 3.0) to detect our quantitative trait. One QTL was detected for anthracnose resistance. The interval of this QTL ranged from 165.51 cM to 176.33 cM on LG14, and ten markers in this interval that were above the threshold value were considered to be linked markers to the anthracnose resistance trait. The phenotypic variance explained by each marker ranged from 16.2 to 19.9 \%, and their LOD scores varied from 3.22 to 4.04. Conclusions: High-density genetic maps for walnut containing 16 LGs were constructed using the SLAF-seq method with an F1 population. One QTL for walnut anthracnose resistance was identified based on the map. The results will aid molecular marker-assisted breeding and walnut resistance genes identification.},

Several studies have investigated the variations of intron length, GC content, ordinal position in a gene and divergence. However, there is little study about the structural variation of exons and introns.                                         Results                                We investigated the length, GC content, ordinal position and divergence in both exons and introns of 13 eukaryotic genomes, representing plant and animal. Our analyses revealed that three basic patterns of exon-intron variation were present in nearly all analyzed genomes (                 P                 {$<$} 0.001 in most cases): an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron, a co-variation between exon and its flanking introns in their length, GC content and divergence, and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the total exon numbers of a gene increased. In addition, we observed that the shorter introns had either low or high GC content, and the GC content of long introns was intermediate.                                                        Conclusion               Although the factors contributing to these patterns have not been identified, our results provide three important clues: common factor(s) exist and may shape both exons and introns; the ordinal reduction patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution; and the larger first and last exons may be splicing-required. These clues provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.},

However, there is little study about the structural variation of exons and introns.                                         Results                                We investigated the length, GC content, ordinal position and divergence in both exons and introns of 13 eukaryotic genomes, representing plant and animal. Our analyses revealed that three basic patterns of exon-intron variation were present in nearly all analyzed genomes (                 P                 {$<$} 0.001 in most cases): an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron, a co-variation between exon and its flanking introns in their length, GC content and divergence, and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the total exon numbers of a gene increased. In addition, we observed that the shorter introns had either low or high GC content, and the GC content of long introns was intermediate.                                                        Conclusion               Although the factors contributing to these patterns have not been identified, our results provide three important clues: common factor(s) exist and may shape both exons and introns; the ordinal reduction patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution; and the larger first and last exons may be splicing-required. These clues provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The decrease of meiotic exchanges (crossing over and conversion) in two mutants of Sordaria macrospora correlated strongly with a reduction of chiasmata and of both types of "recombination nodules." Serial section reconstruction electron microscopy was used to compare the synapsis pattern of meiotic prophase I in wild type and mutants. First, synapsis occurred but the number of synaptonemal complex initiation sites was reduced in both mutants. Second, this reduction was accompanied by, or resulted in, modifications of the pattern of synapsis. Genetic and synaptonemal complex maps were compared in three regions along one chromosome arm divided into well marked intervals. Reciprocal exchange frequencies and number of recombination nodules correlated in wild type in the three analyzed intervals, but disparity was found between the location of recombination nodules and exchanges in the mutants. Despite the twofold exchange decrease, sections of the genome such as the short arm of chromosome 2 and telomere regions were sheltered from nodule decrease and from pairing modifications. This indicated a certain amount of diversity in the control of these features and suggested that exchange frequency was dependent not only on the amount of effective pairing but also on the localization of the pairing sites, as revealed by the synaptonemal complex progression in the mutants.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Meiotic chromosomes have been studied for many years, in part because of the fundamental life processes they represent, but also because meiosis involves the formation of homolog pairs, a feature which greatly facilitates the study of chromosome behavior. The complex events involved in homolog juxtaposition necessitate prolongation of prophase, thus permitting resolution of events that are temporally compressed in the mitotic cycle. Furthermore, once homologs are paired, the chromosomes are connected by a specific structure: the synaptonemal complex. Finally, interaction of homologs includes recombination at the DNA level, which is intimately linked to structural features of the chromosomes. In consequence, recombination-related events report on diverse aspects of chromosome morphogenesis, notably relationships between sisters, development of axial structure, and variations in chromatin status. The current article reviews recent information on these topics in an historical context. This juxtaposition has suggested new relationships between structure and function. Additional issues were addressed in a previous chapter ( 551 ).},

Our results suggest that strong co-linearity exists among the three A Brassica genomes (Ar, An and Aj) but with apparent subgenomic variation. Population genetic analysis on three A-genome carrying Brassica species support the idea that B. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different A genome progenitor of B. napus.},
